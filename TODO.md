# D&D 5e Combat Tracker - Development TODO

## Project Overview
**Vision:** A lightweight, web-based D&D combat tracker focusing on action economy management and initiative tracking, with real-time multiplayer sync and no login requirements.

**Core Philosophy:** 
- Encourage physical dice rolls (don't replace them, but give them the option)
- Minimal setup overhead
- Ephemeral sessions (no persistent data storage needed)
- Action economy clarity above all else

---

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack Decisions
- [X] **Frontend:** Next.js 15+ with React
- [X] **Real-time Sync:** Supabase Realtime (database-driven real-time updates)
- [X] **UI Framework:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn
- [X] **State Management:** React Context + useReducer (avoid Redux for MVP)
- [X] **Deployment:** Vercel (seamless Next.js integration)

## Notes

**Design Principles:**
1. **Clarity over Complexity:** If it's not clear at a glance, redesign it
2. **Speed over Features:** Fast setup beats comprehensive data
3. **Collaboration over Control:** Empower players, don't gate everything behind DM
4. **Complement, Don't Replace:** Work alongside existing tools and dice

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Requiring extensive setup before play
- Hiding essential information in menus
- Making players passive observers
- Over-automating D&D rules
- Creating yet another VTT/character sheet tool
