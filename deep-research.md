Me: I want to build a campaign manager for D&D 5th Edition (2024 ruleset). This is a tool for Dungeon Masters only and will have no player input. The tech stack is Next.js, App Router, Shadcn, Tailwindcss, Typescript, Supabase db / realtime, Supabase auth. It should support email+password login only for now, with email verification, ability to reset password, delete account, one-time-passcode verification.

The actual content of Psychic Damage (the name of the tool) is something I want to refine. Dungeon mastering is divided into two main phases: Planning and execution. This tool aims to assist with both. It needs to be able to access a compendium of D&D 5e monsters with updated ruleset from the 2024 revision. The primary goal is to be able to plan encounters, add party members, manage multiple campaigns, facilitate combat with an initiative / health tracker. It should be feature-rich while being seamless and slick to use, intuitive, not overly complicated, mostly stock shadcn. It should utilize shadcn's latest sidebar implementation to navigate around the application. 

What I want you to do is do some market research on existing tools like Shieldmaiden (formerly harmless key), DnD Beyond, and any other tools that currently exist but are not fulsome / complete / feature rich. This should be a one-stop-shop to manage campaigns. Come up with an implementation plan using the stack that I will drop into Cursor and build out a LLM-compatible implementation plan. Identify some key features we can target to really drive customers to sign up.

ChatGPT: Thanks! To conduct thorough market research and create a focused implementation plan, could you please clarify a few points:

1. Are you targeting hobbyist DMs, professional DMs (e.g., on StartPlaying), or both?
2. Should I prioritize research into tools that are web-based only, or also include apps (iOS/Android, desktop)?
3. Are you planning to monetize this tool eventually? If so, should I identify monetization strategies (subscription tiers, freemium, etc.)?
4. Any geographic/language focus for initial user base?

Once I have this, I’ll kick off the research right away.

Me: 1. Both! It should be easy enough to use for a beginner to pick up and feature-rich enough for professionals to use.
2. Let's focus on web-based only as this will be a web app. However, in your research, identify some features of existing ios, android, and desktop apps that could easily be implemented on a web solution.
3. Yes, ideally, if Wizards of the Coast doesn't come knocking down my door. It needs to be compliant with their terms of use. Might just be a free app with patreon support for better custom features like additional campaigns, etc.
4. North america / english language.

ChatGPT: Great. I’ll research current web-based campaign management tools like Shieldmaiden and D&D Beyond, along with relevant mobile/desktop solutions, to identify gaps in the market and opportunities for innovation. I’ll focus on features valuable to both hobbyist and professional DMs, ensuring compatibility with the D&D 5e 2024 ruleset. I’ll also look into monetization approaches that align with Wizards of the Coast’s policies.

Once done, I’ll return with a report that includes an implementation roadmap for your tech stack, market positioning suggestions, and standout features that can drive sign-ups.

# Psychic Damage: D\&D 5e DM Tool Research & Implementation Plan

## Analysis of Existing DM Tools (Web-Based)

**Shieldmaiden (formerly Harmless Key):** A comprehensive web app billed as “the ultimate D\&D 5e DM companion”. Shieldmaiden combines an **encounter builder**, **initiative tracker**, and **combat manager** in one platform. Its feature set is notably rich, including: automatic hit and damage calculations, condition tracking with reminders, handling of damage types (resistances/vulnerabilities), and dynamic updates to combatants’ stats during encounters. It even offers quality-of-life extras like atmospheric enhancements (adding a background image or music to an encounter) and a **live player-facing initiative list** that updates in real-time. Shieldmaiden allows custom homebrew content with a **Monster Creator** and **Spell Creator** built-in. A standout strength is its integration with D\&D Beyond characters: a user-created Chrome extension can import player characters’ stats from D\&D Beyond into Shieldmaiden, bridging official content with the tool. **Strengths:** Extremely feature-rich (surpassing other tools in automation and tracking capabilities), polished UI, and free core features. User testimonials praise its quality and detail, calling it “hands down the best” encounter tracker and a “godsend” for reducing DM overhead. **Weaknesses:** As a web app, it requires internet access and modern browser support (no offline mode). Its breadth of features can entail a learning curve. Also, to remain legal it is limited to SRD content (users must input any non-SRD monsters themselves). Some advanced features (like larger campaign storage, soundboards, etc.) are gated behind paid tiers, which could be a consideration for DMs on a budget.

**D\&D Beyond (Official):** D\&D Beyond is the officially licensed digital toolkit by Wizards of the Coast, offering character management, a compendium of rules/content, and lately an **Encounter Builder and Combat Tracker** (the encounter builder is out of beta and the combat tracker was introduced in alpha for subscribers). **Strengths:** Being official, its biggest advantage is seamless integration of official content – any monsters, spells, or characters you own on the platform plug directly into the encounter builder. The encounter builder boasts the **most complete monster database** (all published 5e monsters, with search and filter by CR, type, etc.) and auto-calculates encounter difficulty based on the party’s levels. The UI is clean and minimal, consistent with the D\&D Beyond site style. **Weaknesses:** Despite its official status, the combat tracker is widely regarded as bare-bones. It essentially only tracks turn order and allows rolling for monster attacks – “that’s it”. DMs cannot easily apply conditions, automate damage, or adjust player stats mid-combat, leaving much of the bookkeeping to the DM. One review went so far as to say the D\&D Beyond combat tracker “has less utility than a notebook and a pen,” since it fails to offload the usual DM burdens of math, status tracking, and remembering effects. In practice, many DMs find D\&D Beyond’s toolset incomplete for running combat and still resort to external tools or manual methods. Another drawback is that some features (like the combat tracker itself and direct character integration) require a **paid subscription**, and the site’s UI can be distracting with its header/navigation visible during play. In summary, D\&D Beyond excels at content management and official integration, but its DM encounter tools are relatively weak on automation and depth.

**Kobold Fight Club (KFC – “Kobold Plus Fight Club”):** A long-standing free web tool focused on **encounter planning** rather than tracking. **Strengths:** KFC has an excellent **encounter builder** with extensive filters to find monsters from the SRD by name, CR, type, environment, alignment, size, etc.. It instantly calculates the encounter difficulty for a given party, and even offers **random encounter generation** (with presets like “fully random,” “boss + minions,” “horde,” etc.) that respects filters like environment or monster type. This is a huge boon for inspiration – e.g., you can generate a “boss with minions” encounter in a desert with one click. The interface is utilitarian but effective: all controls, monster listings, and the encounter overview reside on one page, avoiding page navigation during design. KFC also lets you **import custom monsters** (via Google Sheets, CSV, or JSON) if a needed creature isn’t in the database. **Weaknesses:** It’s purely a planning tool – there is **no built-in initiative or HP tracking during combat**. DMs must export the encounter to a tracker (KFC provides one-click export to Improved Initiative) or handle combat by other means. Also, by default it only includes SRD monsters, so anything outside the SRD must be added manually or via import (there is no official content beyond the open-source SRD). The design, while functional, can feel slightly cluttered on smaller screens since it packs a lot of information in one view. In short, KFC is superb for building encounters and finding the right monsters, but it doesn’t help run those encounters live.

**Improved Initiative:** A free web-based **combat tracker** designed to run encounters smoothly (the developer calls it “the original combat tracker for D\&D 5E”). **Strengths:** It is highly refined for its purpose, often praised as one of the most full-featured combat managers available. Improved Initiative allows adding PCs and custom monsters to an encounter, and comes with a data repository (users report it includes essentially all Monster Manual stats out-of-the-box). Notable features include a **Player View** mode: you can share a live web link so players see turn order and relevant info on their devices or a screen. It supports tracking of initiative order, HP, and conditions, and lets the DM apply damage/healing directly to creatures (auto-calculating remaining HP). You can roll attacks and damage *within* the app with one click, speeding up gameplay by handling dice and math for the DM. Improved Initiative also allows pre-planning encounters and saving them, so you can prep multiple fights and then load them during the session with ease. **Weaknesses:** It’s an independent tool that stores data locally in the browser by default, which means your campaign info is tied to one device unless you manually export/import a JSON file. (They do offer cloud sync as a perk for Patreon supporters at \$1/month, which removes this limitation.) The UI, while powerful, can be initially overwhelming and may require time to learn and to input all your campaign’s data. Also, like most unofficial tools, it operates within the SRD/OGL content set – however, many DMs have found ways to include full Monster Manual data, and the tool even allows copying and tweaking such content for personal use. Overall, Improved Initiative’s strength is in running combats efficiently with lots of automation; its main drawbacks are data portability (in free version) and the need to set up your data beforehand.

**Other Notable Tools:**

* **Hero Muster:** Another web-based encounter & initiative tracker comparable to Improved Initiative. It offers adding PCs/NPCs and includes Monster Manual creatures for search. Its feature set is robust, but like Improved Initiative, data is stored locally (no cloud sync) which was a noted downside. Improved Initiative essentially emerged as a more polished evolution of what Hero Muster provided.

* **World Anvil & Obsidian Portal:** These are campaign management platforms (web-based) focusing on **worldbuilding, note organization, and player-facing lore**. World Anvil, for example, lets DMs create wiki-style pages for locations, NPCs, and timelines. However, such tools lack integrated encounter building or combat tracking – DMs often use them for story and setting documentation, then switch to other apps for actual combat or encounter management. This separation indicates an opportunity for a unified tool.

* **Mobile Apps (Game Master 5e, etc.):** On mobile and desktop, some all-in-one DM tools have flourished with features that web tools could emulate. *Game Master 5th Edition* (by Lion’s Den) on iOS/Android is a prime example – it lets DMs **build campaigns, create encounters quickly, track PCs and NPCs, assign treasure, and reference rules** on the fly. It contains tabs for a bestiary, items, and spells (drawn from the SRD) so a DM has a mini-compendium at their fingertips. Users found it “reduces game prep dramatically” and is intuitive to use. Similarly, the free *5e Companion App* offers an array of tools in one package: character sheets, a party tracker, a **combat manager for turn order/HP/conditions**, a homebrew content manager, a “terrain builder” for encounter environments, and a built-in monster manual. These mobile apps show the value of integrating all aspects (characters, monsters, combat, loot, notes) into a single interface. Their UIs are optimized for touch and often work offline, which is a plus for mobile. **Weaknesses/Gaps:** Many mobile apps are platform-specific or have limited cross-device access. Data entry on mobile can be tedious compared to a web interface on PC. Also, because they rely on SRD content, users still must input or import missing data (as one reviewer noted, they had to manually add non-SRD races/backgrounds into Fight Club 5e). Nonetheless, their feature completeness and convenience highlight several ideas that a web app like Psychic Damage could borrow.

## Innovative Features to Port from Other Platforms

Web-based DM tools can gain a lot by adopting successful ideas from dedicated mobile/desktop apps and virtual tabletops:

* **Integrated Rule/Content Compendium:** Mobile apps like Game Master 5e include built-in references for monsters, spells, and items so DMs don’t need to flip through books. Porting this to web means having a **compendium section** (SRD-based) accessible within the app. Psychic Damage should embed an SRD 5e compendium (monsters, basic rules, spells) with search functionality, so a DM can quickly pull up a monster stat block or spell description mid-game. This keeps everything in one place and speeds up gameplay.

* **Seamless Encounter Prep to Execution:** Many current solutions split the workflow (e.g. build in one tool, run in another). Shieldmaiden and Game Master 5e demonstrate the advantage of a unified approach: design encounters and then run them with one click. Psychic Damage should allow DMs to **pre-create encounters** (with all monsters, traps, etc.) and then activate an encounter to enter a combat-tracker mode. Preplanning ensures minimal downtime during sessions.

* **Player-Facing View or Screen:** A standout feature in Improved Initiative and Shieldmaiden is the ability to show players a limited view of combat order and status on a separate device or screen. This enhances transparency and player engagement. Psychic Damage can implement a **“Live Initiative Tracker” webpage** that players can join (read-only) to see the turn order, their own HP or status, etc., updating in real time. Using Supabase’s real-time capabilities, this can be done with minimal latency. Features like hiding monster names or HP from that view (customizable visibility) would give the DM control over what players see.

* **Contextual Audio/Visual Aids:** Shieldmaiden has an innovative atmosphere feature – adding a background image per encounter and even a soundboard for music/ambient sounds. While Psychic Damage is “web-only” (not a full VTT with maps), it can still offer a sidebar for **ambience control**, e.g. embedding a YouTube soundtrack, triggering sound effects, or showing an illustration to players. These touches, borrowed from VTTs and all-in-one apps, greatly enhance immersion without needing a grid map.

* **Homebrew Content Creation & Import:** Modern DM apps often allow creating custom monsters or importing community content. Shieldmaiden includes Monster and Spell creators to fill gaps in the limited SRD data. Kobold Fight Club and Improved Initiative enable importing custom JSON data. Psychic Damage should have an **easy homebrew creator** for monsters/NPCs and perhaps items. This could include templates (so a DM can quickly create a variant by tweaking an existing stat block) and import/export options (e.g. import from a JSON or a popular format like improved-initiative or Fight Club files). This encourages adoption by letting DMs bring in their existing libraries.

* **Encounter Difficulty & Balancing Tools:** Kobold Fight Club’s popularity rests on its CR budgeting and encounter difficulty calculator. Porting this feature means Psychic Damage’s encounter builder can show the running XP total of added monsters and indicate the difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard/Deadly) for the given party. Optionally, allow switching between standard 5e encounter math and alternate scaling (like the “MCDM’s ‘Flee, Mortals!’ rules for encounter balance that KFC incorporates). This gives DMs fine control over tuning combat difficulty.

* **Automation in Combat:** Improved Initiative and Shieldmaiden both incorporate automation that many older tools lack – e.g. one-click dice rolls, auto damage calculation, auto tracking of conditions or **concentration** effects, and even handling edge cases (like death saves, monster resistances adjusting damage taken). These features dramatically speed up play. Psychic Damage should emulate this: allow the DM to click on a monster’s attack in the stat block to roll it (with configurable advantage/disadvantage), have the option to auto-calculate if it hits a target based on AC, and if so, roll damage. If a creature has resistance to the damage type, the tool could halve the damage automatically. Conditions (blinded, stunned, etc.) could be applied from a dropdown, which might put an icon on the tracker and possibly enforce simple effects (e.g. remind the DM a creature is stunned and can’t act, or highlight advantage/disadvantage situations). These kinds of features set advanced tools apart from basic trackers.

* **Mobile-Friendly and Offline Support:** Many DMs value being able to run games from a tablet or having a backup if internet is down. While Psychic Damage is a web app, adopting a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** approach could allow caching of data for offline use, at least for viewing compendium info or previously loaded encounters. This draws inspiration from mobile apps (which by nature can be used offline) and could be a differentiator among web tools.

* **Modern UI/UX Practices:** Adopting a clean, intuitive design is crucial (per the user’s note on using Shadcn’s latest sidebar). The app should use a responsive layout with a collapsible sidebar for navigation (campaigns, encounters, compendium, settings) to mimic the refined feel of a desktop application. Quick actions (like keyboard shortcuts for advancing turn or applying damage) are another feature seen in tools like KFC (they display available shortcuts for power users). Psychic Damage can implement similar shortcuts to streamline common actions for advanced users.

By studying these existing tools, Psychic Damage can combine the best elements: the all-in-one campaign scope of mobile apps, the ease-of-use and official content hooks of D\&D Beyond (while remaining system-open), and the powerful combat automation of Shieldmaiden/ImprovedInitiative – all delivered in a slick web interface.

## Common Gaps in Current Products

Despite the variety of tools available, several **pain points** remain under-served, presenting opportunities for Psychic Damage:

* **Unified Campaign Management:** There’s a divide between campaign planning tools and encounter running tools. DMs often use one app for writing notes/world lore (or resort to generic tools like Notion/OneNote) and another for combat. Most combat trackers (Shieldmaiden being a notable exception) don’t incorporate adventure notes, NPC dossiers, or map timelines. Conversely, campaign wiki tools lack combat support. This fragmentation means information can be scattered. Psychic Damage can bridge this by providing lightweight campaign management: e.g. a notes section per campaign, session logs, and NPC directories alongside the mechanical tools. By keeping story info and mechanics in one application, a DM can more fluidly switch contexts.

* **Limited Automation & Tracking in Official Solutions:** As noted, D\&D Beyond’s combat tracker leaves out many DM needs – it doesn’t track conditions, ongoing damage, environment effects, etc., and requires the DM to do a lot manually. Many DMs still end up juggling paper or spreadsheets to track status effects, loot distribution, XP, etc., even when using digital tools. This is a gap Psychic Damage should fill with comprehensive tracking (HP, statuses, initiative, rounds) and extras like a **combat log** for undo/recap (Shieldmaiden logs all damage/healing events so you can review or correct mistakes). A well-implemented combat log with the ability to undo an action is a quality-of-life improvement over most existing trackers.

* **Support for Non-Combat Encounters:** Nearly all current tools emphasize combat encounters only. Non-combat encounters or challenges (traps, puzzles, social encounters) are typically not tracked in these apps beyond maybe note-taking. There’s an opportunity to incorporate simple trackers for things like initiative in a chase scene, or progress clocks for complex skill challenges. Even if it’s just a template in the notes or a turn tracker without monsters, it could help DMs manage those scenarios. This is largely unaddressed in dedicated apps.

* **Content Availability and Legal Hurdles:** A common complaint is the lack of *official* content in third-party tools due to licensing. For example, a DM using a free tool won’t find iconic monsters like beholders or mind flayers preloaded (not in the SRD), and must input them manually. The Black Campbell review of Fight Club 5e notes how missing content (due to SRD limits) required hours of manual data entry for things like additional races. This is inconvenient and can deter users who own the books but can’t use that content digitally without an official platform. While Psychic Damage cannot fix copyright law, it can mitigate the pain by making custom content entry as painless as possible (bulk import options, a community-driven repository of user-created data if legally safe, etc.). Integrations that let DMs leverage content they’ve purchased (e.g. an importer for D\&D Beyond collections via the API or extension) would be a big value-add and somewhat ease this gap without violating terms.

* **Learning Curve and UX Issues:** Some existing tools (especially the more powerful ones like Improved Initiative or Foundry VTT) can overwhelm new DMs. Complex UIs, lack of onboarding, or the need to read documentation can be barriers. An underserved area is **intuitive design** – there is room for a tool that is both powerful **and** easy for beginners. Psychic Damage should prioritize an onboarding tutorial, in-app tips, and sensible defaults (for example, auto-suggesting monsters based on environment, or pre-loading a sample encounter to demonstrate usage). Clean design (leveraging Tailwind UI/Shadcn components) and responsive layouts will also set it apart from some older, clunkier interfaces.

* **Collaboration and Multi-Device Sync:** While not every DM needs it, support for co-DMs or a DM using multiple devices isn’t common. Many tools assume a single user on one device. Features like cloud save (so a DM’s prep on one computer is accessible on another) are sometimes locked behind paywalls or not present (Hero Muster/Improved Initiative had this limitation without Patreon sync). Psychic Damage, by virtue of using Supabase and being web-based, can offer automatic cloud synchronization of data across devices (as long as you log in). This should be standard in the app (with perhaps an offline mode as bonus), not an afterthought.

By recognizing these common gaps, we ensure Psychic Damage targets real user needs that are currently unmet, making it a compelling alternative.

## Compliance with WotC’s Terms and IP Policies

Building a D\&D tool requires careful adherence to Wizards of the Coast’s policies to **avoid IP infringement**. Key considerations include:

* **Use of Open Gaming Content Only:** Psychic Damage will restrict its built-in content to the **5e System Reference Document (SRD 5.1)**, which is available under the Open Game License 1.0a and now Creative Commons. This is the approach used by other safe tools: for example, Shieldmaiden explicitly only includes monsters from the SRD and nothing beyond it. If a user searches for a monster and “can’t find it,” it’s likely because it’s not in the SRD (e.g. many proprietary monsters/spells). Psychic Damage should have similar messaging and encourage DMs to input any non-SRD content themselves for personal use. Under the OGL/CC rules, the mechanics (stat blocks, formulas) can be used, but exact text from books not in the SRD cannot be pre-filled by the app.

* **No Compendium Text from Official Sources:** Beyond the SRD content, any descriptions, artwork, or lore from official D\&D publications are off-limits. Psychic Damage must refrain from including copyrighted text like adventure modules, detailed monster lore, or flavor text that isn’t open content. If an AI feature or user action might generate such text, the app should include warnings or filters (for instance, disallow a prompt like “give me the full stat block for a Beholder” unless the user manually provides that data, since *Beholder* is not in SRD). Storing or sharing user-uploaded non-SRD material should also be kept private (not distributed to other users without permission) to avoid violating content distribution rights.

* **Fan Content Policy Compliance:** Wizards’ Fan Content Policy permits fan-created content **as long as it’s free and includes proper disclaimers**. Psychic Damage should include a disclaimer in its About or footer stating it is *“Unofficial Fan Content permitted under WotC’s Fan Content Policy, not approved/endorsed by Wizards of the Coast, and some content is © Wizards of the Coast”*. This clarifies the tool’s status and respects Wizards’ trademarks. Additionally, the app should avoid using any trademarked logos or trade dress from D\&D (for example, it shouldn’t use the Ampersand dragon logo or styling copied from official books). The name “Psychic Damage” is a generic game term and should be safe, but it’s wise to avoid any names that are explicitly Wizards’ IP or product names.

* **WotC Digital Policy (VTT Policy):** Wizards has at times outlined what virtual tabletop (VTT) platforms can and cannot do with their IP. Psychic Damage is more a management tool than a full VTT (no moving miniatures or displaying official artwork), which is good because showing official graphical assets or automating rulebooks can raise red flags. We should still keep an eye on their **VTT policy guidelines** – for example, Wizards indicated that reproducing text from books or automating the Dungeon Master’s Guide tables could be a problem outside of OGL content. Since Psychic Damage will stick to rules mechanics and user-provided info, it stays on the safe side of these rules. The tool should not, for instance, include the full text of class features or feats unless those are in the SRD.

* **Open Gaming License vs. Creative Commons:** The D\&D 5.1 SRD has been released under CC-BY-4.0 as of 2023, which actually simplifies things – Psychic Damage can use that content as long as attribution is given. We will include the proper attribution to Wizards for the portions of SRD content we use (for example, a note in the docs or about section citing that SRD content © Wizards of the Coast, licensed under CC-BY-4.0). Previously, tools cited the OGL 1.0a – Shieldmaiden still shows OGL 1.0a in its footer. Psychic Damage can similarly include either the OGL or a reference to the CC license to make the legal footing clear.

* **Privacy of User Data:** While not directly a WotC issue, it’s worth noting that if users input their own copyrighted material (like homebrew that contains bits of Forgotten Realms lore, or even notes copied from a module), Psychic Damage should not expose that to others. In technical terms, each user’s campaign data remains in their own account space. Any sharing features (like publishing something) should warn users not to share Wizards’ copyrighted text publicly.

By following these guidelines – using only open content by default, displaying the required disclaimers, and respecting trademarks – Psychic Damage can operate **safely within WotC’s terms**. This ensures the app won’t face legal takedowns and gives users confidence that the tool will have longevity. It’s a path well-trodden by other successful tools in this space.

## Standout LLM-Compatible Features for DMs

One way to differentiate Psychic Damage is by integrating **large language model (LLM)** capabilities (e.g. GPT-4 or similar) to assist the Dungeon Master in creative and time-saving ways. Here are some standout LLM-powered features that could appeal to both hobbyist and professional DMs:

* **AI NPC Generator:** Instantly create fleshed-out non-player characters on the fly. With a click, the DM could get an NPC’s name, a brief description, a quirk or accent, and even a sample dialogue line. For example, if the party wanders into an unscripted shop, the DM can hit “Generate Shopkeeper” and receive: “Mira Telwyn, a middle-aged elf with ink-stained fingers and a warm, if distracted, smile. She speaks in hurried fragments and constantly reorganizes items as she talks. Dialogue: ‘Oh yes, welcome, welcome – mind the books on the floor! I was just cataloguing these new arrivals… Now, what can I do for you?’”. This saves a DM from being caught off guard and adds richness to improvised moments. A hobbyist DM benefits from inspiration; a pro DM running many games can quickly populate their world with distinct NPCs.

* **Dynamic Description & Flavor Text Assistant:** Even the best DMs sometimes struggle to vividly describe a scene or an action. An LLM feature could take a simple prompt (e.g. “ancient forest clearing with standing stones”) and produce a concise, evocative description to read aloud. It could also help narrate combat outcomes: if a player lands a critical hit, the DM could press an “Describe Attack” button to get a flavorful narration (“Your arrow whistles through the air and strikes the orc chieftain’s exposed shoulder joint, eliciting a howl of pain as he staggers”). This helps DMs who aren’t wordsmiths or who are juggling many tasks at once, keeping the game immersive. It’s a feature that would be novel in a web DM tool, leveraging AI for storytelling support.

* **Automated Session Summaries:** Using an LLM to generate summaries of what happened can benefit *professional DMs* who run multiple groups or any DM who wants to maintain continuity. Psychic Damage could have a log where the DM (or the app) notes key events during a session (or the combat log could be used), and then an “Summarize Session” button uses AI to produce a readable recap. The DM can then edit or send this summary to players as a “last time on our campaign…” blurb before the next session. This feature turns raw data (initiative logs, DM notes) into narrative text, saving DMs time writing recaps.

* **Rule and Content Q\&A Helper:** An LLM fine-tuned on the SRD rules could act as a quick rules reference in natural language. For instance, a DM could type: “What does *fog cloud* do?” or “How does grappling work again?” and get an instant answer drawn from the SRD content. This would need careful constraint (so it doesn’t pull non-SRD info), but it could significantly speed up rule lookups. Even beyond rules, the DM could ask the assistant for suggestions: “Any ideas for a puzzle involving these standing stones?” and get a few creative ideas. This is essentially having a co-DM assistant on call. (One must ensure the AI’s output doesn’t inadvertently quote proprietary text; sticking to SRD or paraphrasing is key.)

* **Encounter Balancer / Generator (AI-augmented):** Expand on Kobold Fight Club’s idea by letting the DM ask in plain language for encounter suggestions. E.g. “Generate a medium difficulty encounter for 4 level-5 PCs in a swamp”. The AI could propose: “2x Swamp Hag (use Green Hag stats) and 3x Giant Leeches (use Giant Frog stats with modifications) ambush the party from the murky water.” It could even justify why it’s medium difficulty. The DM can then tweak or accept the suggestion, and the monsters would be pulled from the SRD database. This leverages AI for design, not just text, and can spark creativity when a DM is drawing blanks.

* **Interactive Story Builder:** For DMs designing campaigns, an LLM feature could act as a brainstorming tool. For example, a *quest outline generator* where the DM enters a few specifics (“villain: necromancer, setting: mining town, artifact: cursed crown”) and the AI outputs a brief adventure outline or plot hooks. This is especially useful for hobbyist DMs who don’t have hours to prepare – they get a scaffold to work with. Professional DMs might use it to quickly create side quests or custom content for different groups.

All these LLM-powered features should be implemented as **optional assistants** – they never override the DM’s control, but provide suggestions and speed up the creative process. Importantly, they also give Psychic Damage a cutting-edge appeal. Many current tools do not yet integrate AI assistance in a meaningful way, so this could set the platform apart. When implementing, care must be taken to follow OGL content rules (e.g. ensure the model or prompts are designed not to regurgitate full copyrighted text). But overall, LLM compatibility can make Psychic Damage not just a management tool, but a creative partner in the DM’s toolbox.

## Monetization Strategy (IP-Safe)

When monetizing a fan-made D\&D tool, the key is to **charge for features or services, not for D\&D content itself**, to stay within legal and ethical boundaries. Here are viable strategies for Psychic Damage:

* **Freemium Model – Core Free, Premium Tier:** Offer all essential features for free, and provide additional convenience features or capacity in a paid tier. Shieldmaiden follows this model: “All of our core features are available for free, forever,” with paid tiers for DMs running larger campaigns or who want extra quality-of-life features. Psychic Damage could similarly keep things like the base campaign tools, encounter builder, and combat tracker free, but monetize premium additions such as: increased storage (e.g. more campaigns or NPC entries), the ability to upload larger images or more audio tracks for ambience, advanced analytics (session stats, damage charts), or priority access to new AI features. This way, no one is paying for actual D\&D IP; they’re paying for app enhancements and capacity.

* **Patreon or Subscription Support Tiers:** Many indie tools sustain themselves via Patreon. Improved Initiative, for example, is free but suggests a \$1/month Patreon subscription to enable cloud sync rather than manual data export. Psychic Damage can have an official Patreon with tiers that correspond to perks: e.g. **Supporter Tier** (\$3-5/mo) might give a special badge, priority feature requests, and perhaps early access to beta features; a higher **Pro Tier** might include everything from Supporter plus things like unlimited campaigns, custom theming, or integration with other services. The language should be framed as supporting development rather than buying D\&D content. Patreon’s advantage is flexibility and community-building (supporters feel they are part of the project’s life). It also aligns well with WotC’s fan content policy, which allows donations and sponsorships as long as core content remains accessible.

* **One-Time Purchase or License:** On mobile, apps like Game Master 5e and Fight Club 5e use a one-time purchase to unlock full functionality (often around \$2–\$5). For a web app, implementing one-time purchases is possible (through something like Stripe for a “lifetime premium” account), though the trend nowadays is toward recurring subscriptions for ongoing support. Still, Psychic Damage could offer a one-time “Lifetime Membership” at a higher price point for those who prefer not to have recurring payments, alongside a monthly option for flexibility.

* **Feature Gating (Carefully):** Some features can be reserved for paying users, but be cautious not to gate anything that involves core D\&D rules (which might be seen as monetizing the rules). Good candidates for gating are *convenience features* – e.g., **Cloud Save/Sync** (as mentioned, free users might have local save with manual export, premium get auto cloud sync across devices), **Customization** (premium users can perhaps customize the UI theme or use a campaign-specific subdomain to share player view), **Integrations** (for instance, integration with Discord for game session notifications, or with calendar scheduling), and **AI-powered features** (LLM API calls can be costly, so offering them to subscribers ensures the service is sustainable and casual free users don’t abuse the API). This gating must still keep the base app fully useful for free users (so they get hooked and see value in upgrading, rather than feeling the app is crippled without paying).

* **Non-Intrusive Ads or Sponsorships:** A secondary strategy if needed could be using banner ads on the website or finding sponsorship (for example, a dice company sponsoring with a logo). However, ads can detract from a clean UX (which we want to prioritize). If user base grows, a lightweight approach might be a **“Sponsored by XYZ”** message or a rotating tip about a partner product that doesn’t interfere with usage. Given fan content rules, one must ensure sponsors aren’t inappropriate or direct competitors to WotC in a problematic way. For launch, it might be better to focus on community support (Patreon) rather than ads.

* **Marketplace for User Content (Avoiding IP)**: Some tools monetize via marketplaces (like Foundry VTT sells premium modules). Psychic Damage could consider, in the future, a marketplace of entirely original content (user-created adventures or asset packs) if it grows big – but this is tricky territory with D\&D IP. If pursued, it must be restricted to original systems or generic fantasy content, not “Greyhawk Adventure Module X” that infringes IP. For now, this is likely out of scope, but it’s a possible long-term idea (and would require rigorous review to ensure no IP violation).

In all cases, the guiding principle is transparency: make it clear that paying is to support development and unlock app-specific features, not to purchase D\&D material. By structuring monetization around service and convenience, Psychic Damage stays in line with Wizards’ policies (which explicitly allow sponsorships, ads, and donations for fan content) and avoids any implication of selling copyrighted content. A healthy free offering will also encourage adoption, with a subset of power users providing financial support – this model has proven effective for similar tools in the community.

## Implementation Plan (Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase, and More)

Finally, translating all the above research into action, here is a structured implementation plan for **Psychic Damage** aligned with the chosen tech stack (Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, TypeScript, and Supabase):

### 1. Project Setup and UI Framework

* **Next.js App Router Structure:** Initialize a new Next.js 13+ project with the App Router. Organize the app into clear routes: e.g. `/dashboard` (main app after login), `/campaigns/[id]` for a campaign view, which contains sub-pages or components for encounters, etc. Utilize Next.js layouts for persistent UI elements (like the sidebar navigation that should persist across many pages). Ensure the app is configured in TypeScript for type-safety across the codebase.

* **Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI:** Set up Tailwind CSS with a config that suits a “dark mode first” design (many DMs use dark mode during play). Install Shadcn UI (which is essentially a set of Radix UI + Tailwind component libraries) and generate the needed components. Specifically, use Shadcn’s **Sidebar** component for the main navigation menu – this will provide a consistent, responsive sidebar UI as mentioned (Shadcn’s latest sidebar is customizable and mobile-friendly). The sidebar will list navigation items like “Campaigns”, “Encounters”, “Compendium”, “Settings”. Style the app with Tailwind’s utility classes, aiming for a clean look (e.g. minimalistic color scheme, intuitive spacing).

* **Responsive Design:** Right from the start, design components to work on various screen sizes. Many DMs might use a laptop, but some use tablets – with Tailwind’s responsive utilities we can ensure the combat tracker view, for example, reflows nicely on a vertical tablet screen. The Shadcn/Radix components (like modals, dropdowns) will help maintain accessibility and keyboard navigation out-of-the-box, which is important for usability.

* **State Management:** Plan for using React’s built-in context or state management (possibly Zustand or Redux if needed) to handle UI states like the current encounter running, or which campaign is selected, accessible across components. For instance, a context provider for “ActiveEncounter” could allow the initiative list component and the controls component to sync.

### 2. Database Schema Design (Supabase/Postgres)

Design the database schema in Supabase to accommodate campaigns, encounters, and related entities. Proposed tables and relationships:

* **profiles (users):** standard Supabase auth users table (Supabase provides this). Extend with profile info if needed (like display name, Patreon tier, etc.).

* **campaigns:** fields: `id`, `user_id` (owner DM), `title`, `description`, etc. Possibly a `settings` JSON for things like campaign-specific options (e.g. encumbrance rules toggle, or public initiative on/off).

* **players:** represents player characters per campaign. Fields: `id`, `campaign_id` (relation), `name`, `max_hp`, `current_hp`, `ac`, `initiative_bonus`, and optional ability scores or notes. This is essentially a lightweight character sheet for tracking the essentials a DM needs (as noted in Shieldmaiden: they only require name, HP, AC, maybe ability mods if needed for saves). We might allow storing the whole stat block if user inputs it, but that’s optional.

* **monsters:** a master table for creature stat blocks (mainly SRD monsters). Fields might include `id`, `name`, `size`, `type`, `CR`, `HP`, `AC`, attacks, etc. Since SRD monster data is static, we could populate this table initially from an open 5e SRD source. Also allow a flag for “custom/homebrew” vs “official”. Homebrew monsters created by a user could either live in a separate table or in this table linked to a user. Perhaps a separate table `custom_monsters` with a `user_id` and JSON blob of stats if we want to keep official and custom data distinct.

* **encounters:** fields: `id`, `campaign_id`, `name`, `environment/notes`, `round` (if an encounter is actively running, store the current round/turn pointer for persistence), etc. Once an encounter is started, we might create an **encounter state** entry (see next bullet).

* **encounter\_monsters / encounter\_players:** join tables that list which monsters and which player characters are part of an encounter, including their initiative and current HP in that specific encounter. For example, `encounter_monsters` fields: `encounter_id`, `monster_id` (if referencing the monster stat in the monster table, for official or a copy of custom), `name` (we copy name in case of multiples like “Goblin A”), `current_hp`, `initiative`, `status_effects` (could be JSON or a separate related table), etc. Similarly `encounter_players` links a campaign’s players into the encounter with their initiative and current HP at the time (players’ current HP might sync back to the campaign’s player entry after the encounter if we persist damage between fights). Storing these ensures that if the DM closes the app mid-fight or shares the encounter to another device, the state is not lost (Supabase real-time can broadcast state changes based on these tables).

* **notes/journal:** If implementing session notes, a table like `notes` with `campaign_id`, `content`, `created_at`. Alternatively, could use something like Supabase Storage to save rich text or use an external solution, but a simple table works for plaintext/markdown notes.

* **loot/treasures:** Could be a simple feature – if the DM wants to predefine loot for an encounter, a table linking encounters to loot descriptions or item references. Shieldmaiden has a “Loot” reminder that triggers at end of encounter. We can implement similarly: perhaps a text field in encounters for loot notes which can be shown when the encounter is closed.

Supabase’s row-level security should be configured so users can only access their own campaigns and related data. Use Supabase Auth’s user ID to link records.

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

Leverage **Supabase Auth** for user accounts. Likely use email/password signup and perhaps third-party OAuth (Google, etc.) for convenience. Ensure that upon account creation, a new user gets a default “My First Campaign” or a tutorial campaign to start with (to improve onboarding). Implement route protection in Next.js so that the app pages require login (Next.js middleware or protected client-side routes). Also consider allowing a “demo mode” with a temporary in-browser storage if the user just wants to try without account – though given Supabase integration, focusing on real accounts might be simpler.

If planning a Patreon integration for premium features, we might later connect Patreon API to verify supporter status (or use Supabase’s subscription management if using Stripe, but Patreon might remain external for now).

### 4. Core Features Development

**Campaign & Dashboard:** Build a dashboard page listing the user’s campaigns. Allow creating a new campaign (just a name and maybe default settings). Within a campaign view, tabs or sections for: *Encounters*, *Players*, *Notes*, *Compendium*. The sidebar can allow switching campaigns or selecting these sections.

**Player Management:** In the campaign view, implement a form to add player characters (name, HP, AC, etc.). Possibly allow an “Import Character” if later integrating D\&D Beyond or if a user wants to copy from an existing source – for MVP, manual entry is fine. Show the list of players with current HP (which the DM can adjust between sessions if needed).

**Encounter Builder:** This is a crucial piece. On the Encounters tab, allow creating a new encounter: the DM can select from the list of campaign players (checkbox which players will participate), and add monsters. For adding monsters, implement a **monster search component** that pulls from the `monsters` table (SRD data) and the user’s custom monsters. Include filters (by CR, type, environment, name search, etc.) similar to Kobold Fight Club’s interface. Each time a monster is added, display the running XP total and difficulty rating for the party (use 5e’s encounter difficulty guidelines). This calculation involves summing monster XP (adjusted by number of monsters multiplier) and comparing to party thresholds – code this logic or use existing SRD data for XP thresholds. Indicate “Easy/Medium/Hard/Deadly” visibly. Also allow editing monster quantity (e.g., 3 goblins). If multiple of the same monster are added, list them as separate entries (Goblin 1, 2, 3) for tracking.

**Combat Tracker (Encounter Run):** When the DM clicks “Start Encounter”, transition to a Combat Tracker view (maybe route `/campaigns/[id]/encounters/[encounterId]/run`). This will use the encounter\_monsters and encounter\_players data to display the initiative order. Key elements to implement:

* **Roll or Input Initiative:** Provide a button to roll initiative for all monsters (using their dex mod) or individually. For PCs, the DM can input their rolled initiatives (or in future, if players have an app interface, they could input themselves). Once all initiatives are in, sort the turn order list automatically.
* **Turn Display and Controls:** Highlight the current turn combatant. Show relevant stats: for PCs maybe just name, HP, conditions; for monsters: name, HP, an icon if they have any status conditions. Include next/previous turn buttons to advance combat. When advancing, automatically increment round counter when the turn cycles back to the first.
* **HP and Damage Management:** Next to each combatant, have controls to quickly adjust HP. For example, a “-” and “+” button or an input field for damage/healing. If damage is applied to a monster, and it drops to 0 or below, mark it as defeated (could auto-remove from initiative or grey it out). Implement the **damage type vs resistance logic**: if the monster has known resistances (from monster data), allow the DM to specify damage type on an attack (or have a toggle like “halved” if they know it should be halved). Automate common rules: e.g., if a monster is vulnerable, double the damage.
* **Conditions and Effects:** For each combatant, provide a dropdown or icon menu of conditions (Blinded, Charmed, etc., as per 5e conditions). When applied, possibly annotate that combatant’s entry (with an icon or colored label). This is mainly a reminder to the DM (full automation of conditions is complex, but e.g. if “Stunned” is applied, maybe the app could auto-skip that creature’s turn unless unchecked). At minimum, logging conditions applied is useful. Also, a note field per combatant for custom reminders (Shieldmaiden allowed custom reminders, e.g. “Orc chief - next attack has advantage”).
* **Dice Roller Integration:** Implement a simple dice roller utility that can be invoked for a selected combatant’s attack or check. We might integrate a library or write a parser for dice notation (e.g. roll 2d6+3). The monster stat blocks will have attack information; we can parse those strings to know what to roll. Display the result to the DM (and possibly log it). This saves time compared to manual rolling, especially for multiple NPCs. Ensure randomness uses a reliable source (Crypto API or a well-tested RNG) for fairness.
* **Combat Log:** As actions happen (damage, heals, conditions, rolls), append entries to a combat log panel. For example, “Round 2, Turn 1 – Goblin dealt 7 slashing damage to Aria (Aria HP 10→3)” or “Aria casts **Bless** (Concentration)”. The log helps track what has happened. Having an undo function (e.g. if the DM accidentally applied damage to the wrong target, they can remove that log entry and restore the HP) would be excellent.
* **End Encounter:** When combat is over, provide an option to end the encounter. At this point, trigger any **loot display** (show the pre-entered loot or XP rewards). Also update the campaign’s player data with their new current HP (if you carry wounds forward, as Shieldmaiden does, unless the DM resets them manually). Clear temporary encounter data from state.

**Compendium & Tools:** Include a section (maybe in sidebar: “Compendium”) where the DM can search the SRD rules – spells, items, conditions, etc. This can simply query the monsters table or a spells table (if we include one) by name. Providing quick rule references (like condition definitions) will be helpful. Also, allow the DM to open any monster’s full stat block from here or from within an encounter. This is basically the reference library part of the app.

**Homebrew Monster/Item Creator:** Under a “Tools” or within compendium, allow creating a new monster entry. It can be a form where the user fills in fields (name, stats, actions). At minimum, provide a markdown or rich-text editor for description and an ability to define custom actions. Store this in `custom_monsters` linked to user (or in monsters table flagged as user content). Similar for custom items or spells if those are in scope (possibly phase 2). This feature ensures DMs can add what’s missing due to SRD limits.

### 5. LLM Feature Integration

Implement AI-powered features carefully:

* For example, an **“AI Assistant”** button in the app could open a sidebar chat or modal where the DM can select a function (NPC generator, describe scene, etc.). When the DM inputs a prompt or request, the app will call an LLM API (likely OpenAI’s, given its widespread use) with a tailored prompt to generate the result.
* Use **TypeScript** to create utility functions for each AI feature (e.g., `generateNPC()` that hits an edge function or API route, since we might not want to expose the API key directly in the client). Supabase Edge Functions or Next.js API routes can securely proxy these calls.
* Add guards to the prompts to keep outputs “safe for work” and within D\&D context. Also, instruct the LLM not to quote lengthy passages from any source (to avoid IP issues) – basically the prompt will emphasize creativity and brevity (the LLM should create original text, not quote rules).
* Example: For NPC generator, send a prompt like: *“You are a creative assistant for a D\&D Dungeon Master. Provide a brief interesting NPC description including name, one-line appearance/personality, and an optional sample quote. No stat numbers.”* This yields a quick NPC.
* For summarizing session logs, we can feed the log text (if short) or use techniques to condense it if long, then ask the LLM to summarize in past tense third-person.
* Each AI feature should be tested to ensure it provides useful output consistently. Possibly allow the DM to refine results (e.g., a “Regenerate” button if they don’t like the first output).
* **LLM Usage for rules Q\&A:** If implementing, we might fine-tune a smaller model on SRD rules or use OpenAI with a system message containing the SRD text relevant to a query. This might be complex; an alternative is a search-based approach (like query a prepared index of the SRD rules and then let the AI answer based on that). This might be a later addition; for launch, focus on the creative AI helpers (NPC, descriptions, ideas) which carry no risk of verbatim IP copy.

These features would be marked as beta or premium depending on the monetization decision (since AI API calls incur cost). We would also implement usage limits for non-premium users (e.g., 5 AI requests per day for free accounts) to manage costs, inviting heavy users to subscribe for more.

### 6. Real-time and Collaboration Features

Supabase Realtime (which leverages Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY) will be used to push updates to connected clients. Key real-time aspects:

* **Live Initiative Tracker for Players:** When a DM starts an encounter and perhaps clicks “Share Initiative”, the app can generate a unique hash (or use the encounter ID) for a read-only player view. We can have a public route like `/live/[encounterHash]` that anyone with the link can open. This page will use Supabase’s client subscription to listen to changes in the encounter (specifically the order of turns, HP changes for visible entities, etc.). It will display the turn order list, highlighting who’s up, and maybe a simplified HP bar for each player character. Monster information on this view should be limited (perhaps just “Goblin 1” with a generic icon and maybe a question mark HP or just “Alive/Down” status, depending on DM’s choice of visibility). We’ll achieve this by storing a minimal public state for the encounter – possibly a sanitized version of the encounter data. Simpler: the live page could subscribe to the same tables but our query only selects allowed fields (Supabase policies can restrict what a anon user can select). We’ll need to secure it so that only that encounter’s data is exposed via the hash (perhaps use a random UUID as a “view key” in the encounter table, so it’s not guessable).
* **Multi-device DM use:** If a DM logs in on two devices (or a co-DM logs in with the same account for a session), actions on one should reflect on the other. Supabase’s realtime on tables will handle this naturally – when an encounter record or related HP record updates, all subscribers (the DM’s other device) see it. So the DM can, say, use a tablet as a secondary screen or let an assistant DM adjust things simultaneously.

Test the real-time by simulating two clients: ensure initiative order resorting, HP adjustments, condition adds all propagate instantly.

### 7. Testing and Iteration

Before launch, do thorough testing:

* Create a sample campaign with encounters of varying complexity (multiple monsters, summons, lair actions perhaps) to see if the app can handle edge cases.
* User Testing: If possible, recruit a few DM users to try a session with Psychic Damage. Get feedback on the UI flow: is adding monsters quick? Is the combat screen clear and not cluttered? Take their feedback to refine the UX (e.g., maybe add a “next turn” keyboard shortcut like spacebar, or allow double-click on a monster to subtract HP quickly, etc.).
* Performance: Optimize database calls – use indexes for searching monsters by name/CR. Supabase should handle moderate load, but we should use pagination or limits on any monster list queries to avoid pulling hundreds of records at once unnecessarily. Also, ensure images (like uploaded NPC portraits or encounter background images) are stored in Supabase Storage or an CDN and loaded efficiently.
* Security: Double-check row-level security so that user A cannot ever access user B’s data via any API route. Also validate inputs (to prevent any SQL injection, though using Supabase client libraries mitigates that) and escape any user-generated content displayed (to prevent XSS, e.g., if notes support markdown, sanitize it).

### 8. Design Polishing

In parallel with functionality, polish the UI:

* Use Tailwind to create a consistent color theme (perhaps a dark theme with a few accent colors reminiscent of D\&D’s feel, but avoid direct copying of their styles). Shadcn components (buttons, dialogs, tabs) will give a modern look and feel consistent across the app.
* Implement a toggle for dark/light mode, as some users prefer light mode for readability. Tailwind’s dark mode class strategy can handle this easily.
* Ensure the layout accounts for running the app alongside other windows – e.g., a DM might have this on one half of a screen and a VTT or video chat on the other. So, avoid fixed massive widths; let it be fluid or easily resizable.
* Add icons where appropriate (Shadcn uses some Lucide icons by default). For example, an icon for “roll dice” or a small icon on conditions.
* Incorporate the Psychic Damage branding (if any logo or identifying graphic exists, or create a simple one). This is just to give it a unique identity but avoid any D\&D trademark (so no ampersand dragon logos).

### 9. Monetization Implementation

If launching with a premium tier:

* Integrate a payment system (Stripe) or Patreon login integration. Stripe could handle monthly subscriptions. Supabase has Stripe integration in their examples which could simplify this. Alternatively, manage a manual system of coupon codes for early adopters if not doing full billing at launch.
* Gate features in the UI based on user’s subscription status (e.g., stored in the `profiles` table as `is_premium`). For instance, if AI features are premium, the button to use them could be labeled “Pro” and clicking it could prompt upgrade for free users.
* If using Patreon, possibly provide a code to supporters or an OAuth to Patreon to verify. This might be more complex, so a straightforward Stripe subscription might be easier for MVP.

### 10. Launch and Beyond

* **Alpha/Beta Release:** Do a soft launch (maybe a closed beta) with a small group from local DMs or online (keeping it North America-focused and English-only as specified, we don’t need localization initially). Monitor for any bugs or performance issues as multiple users come on.
* **Feedback Loop:** Set up a feedback channel (could be a Discord or an in-app feedback form) to gather user suggestions. Prioritize fixes and popular feature requests.
* **Post-launch Features:** Plan to continuously improve based on earlier sections – e.g., maybe integrate a simple **timeline tool** for campaign events (if users want to log events chronologically), or a **map integration** with external map tools (like linking to Owlbear Rodeo for those who do want a map).
* **Stay Updated with WotC:** Keep an eye on any changes in the D\&D landscape (for instance, the upcoming One D\&D rules might update the SRD; we should update our compendium accordingly when that time comes). Also watch for any official stance on 3rd-party digital tools – staying compliant will be an ongoing task.

By following this implementation roadmap, Psychic Damage will be built on a strong technical foundation tailored to the user’s needs. The plan emphasizes clean design, comprehensive features, and respect for legal boundaries. With iterative development and community feedback, Psychic Damage can carve out its place as a go-to web app for Dungeon Masters seeking an intuitive yet powerful campaign management and combat tool.
