Conversation with ChatGPT Deep Research:

Me: I'm looking to build a tool for Dungeons and Dragon's 5th Edition (with the revised 2024 ruleset). I want to corner the market with something for players or DMs or both to improve the overall DnD Plan / Play experience. Do some market research and identify any gaps where existing tools are either prohibitively expensive or don't exist yet.

ChatGPT: Could you clarify what kind of tool you're considering? For example:

1. Are you thinking about a digital character builder, campaign planner, encounter tracker, world-building tool, VTT (virtual tabletop), or something else?
2. Do you want it to be web-based, mobile, desktop, or cross-platform?
3. Are you looking to target casual players, power users, Dungeon Masters, or a mix?
4. Any regions or languages you'd like to prioritize?

These details will help focus the market gap analysis effectively.

Me: 1. My first thought is a combat turn tracker / chess timer type thing so everyone knows whose turn it is / the order of turns and players are able to track action / bonus action / etc. Something to keep people organized so combat and general turn based encounters run a bit smoother. Users would each have a client (probably a phone or a laptop) that allows them to control their turn and the DM would manage all the NPCs turns actions, etc. Should be extensible and customizeable for homebrew. I'm open to making a wider tool to encapsulate character builder / campaign builder but these exist already.
2. Web-based to start to enable cross-platform out of the box.
3. A mix. Should be available for anyone.
4. English only.

ChatGPT: Great, I’ll research the current landscape of Dungeons & Dragons 5e tools, focusing on combat turn trackers and action management systems, especially with respect to the 2024 ruleset. I’ll look for gaps in affordability, usability, or feature availability—particularly around web-based, cross-platform solutions that support extensibility and player-DM interaction.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a market gap analysis and suggestions for differentiation.

# Market Research: D\&D 5e Combat Turn Trackers & Action Management Tools

## Overview and Context

Managing initiative order and combat actions in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition can be challenging for Dungeon Masters, especially with the upcoming 2024 rules revision (often dubbed *One D\&D*). A variety of digital tools exist to streamline turn tracking, monster management, and the flow of combat. This research reviews the major tools (web-based and cross-platform) for D\&D 5e combat tracking – focusing on features like initiative order tracking, action economy (action/bonus/reaction) management, multi-user remote use, customizability for homebrew content, pricing models, and readiness for the 2024 rules update. The goal is to identify gaps where current solutions are **expensive, lack key functionality, or are not well-suited to web and mobile use**, highlighting opportunities for innovation.

## Key Features and Criteria for Comparison

When evaluating combat trackers and action management systems, the following criteria are key:

* **Turn Order & Round Tracking:** Ability to track initiative order and round count, including easy advancement of turns.
* **Action Economy Tracking:** Indicators for when a character/monster has used its Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction in a round (to prevent confusion and enforce rules).
* **HP, Conditions and Effects:** Tracking of hit points, temporary HP, and status conditions (e.g. stunned, concentrating, etc.), including applying damage/healing to combatants.
* **Automation & Rolls:** Tools that integrate dice rolls for initiative, attacks, or damage, possibly auto-calculating hits and damage application.
* **Monster/Character Data Integration:** Integration with D\&D 5e compendium data – e.g. monster stat blocks, player character stats – and support for **custom/homebrew entries**.
* **Multi-User Remote Access:** Support for multiple clients – e.g. a DM and players each on their own device – seeing a synchronized initiative order or even interacting (for example, players viewing the turn order and possibly tracking their own HP or conditions).
* **Platform & Accessibility:** Web-based tools (browser accessible) that work across desktop and mobile. Native app solutions are noted if relevant, but emphasis is on cross-platform web availability.
* **Pricing Model:** Ranges from free, freemium (free with paid tiers), one-time purchase, or subscription. Important if any tools are viewed as **prohibitively expensive** by the community.
* **2024 Ruleset Updates:** Whether the tool is updated or planning updates for the 2024 revised 5e rules (e.g. new stat block formats, encounter balancing rules, changed conditions like exhaustion).
* **User Experience & Sentiment:** Feedback from users (forums, reviews) on usability, design, and any pain points (e.g. missing features, clunky UI, or workflow issues).

Below is an overview of prominent tools in this space, followed by a comparative table and discussion of gaps and opportunities.

## Major Combat Tracker Tools and Systems

### Official D\&D Beyond Encounter Builder & Combat Tracker (Web)

**Overview:** *D\&D Beyond* (DDB) offers an official encounter builder and combat tracker as part of its digital toolset. The encounter builder (beta) lets DMs assemble encounters using any monsters from their DDB content library, and it automatically calculates encounter difficulty (Challenge Rating budgeting). The combat tracker (currently evolving from alpha) integrates with DDB’s character sheets and monster stat blocks.

**Key Features:** Being official, DDB’s tracker pulls in **all purchased content**: you can add player characters from your DDB campaign with one click, and drag in monsters from official books you own. Stat blocks are at your fingertips, and the DM can click monster actions to roll attacks or damage directly in the interface. The layout is clean and minimalist, showing initiative order, monster HP (editable by DM), and player stats like AC, passive perception, etc., at a glance.

However, **functionality is limited**: the DDB tracker essentially only handles initiative order and monster actions. Crucially, the DM *cannot modify player HP or conditions* in the tracker – players are expected to manage their own character sheets. There is no built-in way to apply damage to PCs or mark conditions on them, undermining the “combat tracker” aspect (it becomes more of a simple initiative tracker). Some basic QoL features are also missing; for example, initially it lacked an easy way to reorder initiative or insert new combatants mid-combat. (Users discovered you *can* add a new monster during combat by editing and resuming the encounter, but it’s clunky.) These omissions led one reviewer to conclude that DDB’s combat tracker “has less utility than a notebook and pen,” since the DM must still manually track most combat info elsewhere.

**Remote Use:** D\&D Beyond is web-based and works on desktop or tablet browsers. Players can’t directly interact with the combat tracker (there’s no separate player view), but since it ties into their character sheets, any updates to a character (e.g. HP changes) by the player will reflect for the DM. Recently, DDB has been integrating the encounter tracker with a new **“Maps” VTT** interface – allowing DMs to run encounters on a digital map with tokens. This Maps tool is becoming the default for *2024 rules* content: for example, the updated 2024 monster stat blocks and encounter-building rules are available **only through the Maps beta**, which has drawn some criticism from DMs who preferred the simpler list-based tracker. DDB’s focus on an immersive VTT means the standalone web tracker may be deprioritized.

**Pricing:** The Encounter Builder and tracker on DDB are free to use for anyone with an account, *but* full utility requires purchases/subscription. Access to beyond-SRD monsters or content requires buying those books digitally. In fact, at one point the combat tracker was gated behind a *paid subscription (Hero Tier or Master Tier)* during alpha, making cost a barrier. Even now, using DDB as a one-stop solution means investing in sourcebooks or an ongoing sub. The cost factor is “a tough pill to swallow” if you’re not already bought into the D\&D Beyond ecosystem. In short, DDB’s official status grants it data integration, but **monetization and incomplete features** are major drawbacks (Arcane Eye rated its feature set 5/10 and cost 1/10 in early 2025).

**User Sentiment:** Users appreciate the polished UI and integration (easy linking of campaign PCs and purchased monsters). The interface is intuitive and “aesthetically pleasing”. But sentiment sours on its limitations: DMs complain that the lack of full control (e.g. no player HP editing or condition tracking) makes it “utterly useless as a combat tracker”. In community discussions, D\&D Beyond is often seen as convenient but not fully sufficient. For example, one Reddit user noted DDB’s tracker “doesn't allow you to insert new monsters or NPC allies after initiative is rolled,” complicating on-the-fly adjustments. Others have noted that only *official* tools like DDB (or Roll20) can legally include all monster data – any free tool will be limited to SRD content unless the DM homebrews the rest. Overall, DDB’s combat tracker is viewed as *promising but undercooked*, and many DMs augment it with other tools to cover the gaps.

### Shieldmaiden (Web; formerly Harmless Key)

**Overview:** *Shieldmaiden* (found at Shieldmaiden.app) is an all-in-one **encounter builder, initiative tracker, and combat manager** designed as a comprehensive DM companion. Launched by independent developers (one of whom is active in the community under the name HarmlessKey), it aims to “organize the chaos and bookkeeping” of D\&D combat. Shieldmaiden combines features that normally would require multiple tools: you can create and store **custom monsters, NPCs, spells, items**, build encounters, and then run those encounters with a robust combat tracker.

**Key Features:** Shieldmaiden’s feature set is notably **rich and modern**. Some highlights:

* **Encounter Building & Homebrew:** You can either import monsters from the 5e SRD or create your own from scratch, using an integrated monster editor. (It supports copying an SRD monster and then tweaking it, to easily create variants.) All monster stats, abilities, saves, resistances, and even spells can be recorded – essentially full monster stat blocks with *clickable roll buttons* for attacks and saves. Encounters can mix these monsters with player characters (you can save player stat profiles too) and will auto-calc difficulty (total CR vs party) as you add combatants. You can also assign **loot** to an encounter for post-battle rewards tracking.

* **Combat Tracker & Action Management:** This is where Shieldmaiden shines. During combat, the DM can **roll virtually everything** for NPCs/monsters directly in the app (attack rolls, damage, saving throws, etc.), and the tool can automatically apply damage to targets with a click. It supports advantage/disadvantage toggling, critical hits, and automatically accounts for resistances or vulnerabilities (with manual override possible). In other words, it can do automatic hit/damage calculation that others lack. The DM has full control to adjust any stat on the fly – e.g. give a creature temporary HP, modify a character’s AC, or apply ongoing effects.

  Shieldmaiden also includes tracking for **conditions and buffs**: there are built-in common conditions (poisoned, stunned, etc.) and a system for **reminders** like spell effects (e.g. who is affected by *Bless* or who is concentrating on a spell). You can create custom conditions or reminders even mid-combat to handle homebrew effects. The interface allows marking if a creature has used its Reaction, or is targeted by someone, etc. – it was built to give DMs “complete control over combat,” including out-of-turn damage events or transformations (like Wild Shape). In fact, a comparison shows Shieldmaiden is the only one (among major trackers) to support advanced features like **conditions, damage type defenses, out-of-turn actions, environmental damage, shape-changing, dynamic stat updates, and even audio/visual ambiance**.

* **Player View and Atmosphere:** Uniquely, Shieldmaiden lets the DM set up a **“player-facing” combat screen** with thematic visuals. You can customize an ambiance for the encounter (e.g. add a background image or animated effects like rain/fog, and even link a YouTube music track for mood). This player view shows the initiative order (you can choose what info players see, e.g. maybe hide monster names or HP if desired), and the atmospheric effects help immerse remote players. Players can view this live initiative list on their own devices, which updates in real time. This caters to remote play: each player can follow the combat on a browser, seeing turn order and any shared info, while the DM runs the encounter behind the scenes.

**Design and Usability:** Shieldmaiden is a web app with a **responsive, app-like interface**. It features a persistent sidebar menu for navigation (campaigns, encounters, monster library, etc.), and uses a multi-column layout in the combat view (center shows all combatants in initiative order with HP bars, left highlights the current turn, right shows the selected target or creature details). Despite packing in a lot of information, the design uses color-coding and collapsible menus to keep it understandable – for example, buttons are colored consistently (confirm/proceed actions vs cancel) and health bars change from green to red as HP goes down. Reviewers note that each part of the user workflow is clearly delineated, and while it’s a complex tool, it “makes use of the real estate efficiently” for all its features. Overall the UI/UX is praised as modern and clean.

**Remote & Cross-Platform:** Being browser-based, Shieldmaiden works on any device with internet and JavaScript. It was built mobile-responsive (the developers tout a “mobile-first approach” elsewhere), so it can be used on a phone or tablet as well as a PC. Multi-user synchronization is via the shared player view link – players don’t need accounts; the DM simply shares the encounter’s public link. Shieldmaiden thus supports in-person games (e.g. display the initiative screen on a TV or tablet for players) and fully remote games (each player can open the link). **Character Sync:** For deeper integration, Shieldmaiden offers a Chrome extension that can sync player character data from D\&D Beyond or DiceCloud directly into the app. This helps keep player stats up-to-date without manual re-entry (particularly useful if characters level up or change HP on their sheet).

In terms of **2024 rules support**, there’s no official statement, but given Shieldmaiden’s comprehensive coverage of 5e mechanics, it can likely accommodate rule changes (e.g. if exhaustion mechanics change, one could add a custom condition for it). The developers are very active – users have noted “rapid updates” and even bug fixes being deployed in the middle of a session. This suggests it will stay current; any new statuses or action types from the 2024 update could be integrated relatively easily.

**Pricing:** Shieldmaiden uses a **freemium model**. The core features are free for all, and the free tier is quite generous (sufficient “for most users” per the developers). All essential functionality – building encounters, tracking combat with all mechanics – is free. The paid subscription (handled via Patreon, \~\$5/month) unlocks certain QoL features and removes some limits. For example, free users can use all features but are limited in number of saved campaigns/encounters or number of combatants per encounter (e.g. up to 6 combatants free). Subscribing increases these limits and adds perks: the ability to upload custom images for character/monster avatars (free tier must use image URLs), access to fancy background effects for the player view, and an upcoming content import/export feature for sharing pre-built encounters. The developers emphasize the goal isn’t profit but sustaining the app’s development, and they offer the key functionality to everyone for free. This pricing approach makes Shieldmaiden far more accessible than tools that lock critical features behind paywalls.

**User Sentiment:** Shieldmaiden has gained an enthusiastic following among DMs who have discovered it. It’s often described as **one of the most comprehensive and high-quality combat trackers available**. In one reviewer’s words, “just the fact that this tool has so many features… beyond any other comparable tool… should be reason enough to try it out”. Users particularly love that it *combines* what used to require multiple apps (initiative tracker + monster manager + encounter builder + audio/visual extras). The ability to handle all the “hectic aspects” of combat – from tracking conditions to rolling attacks – in one place allows DMs to focus more on storytelling and less on bookkeeping.

Critiques are few; because Shieldmaiden is relatively new and under active development, some DMs are simply unaware of it (it “deserves more attention” according to one blog). Some might find the depth of features comes with a learning curve, but overall the UI is praised for its clarity. The only limitation frequently mentioned is the content: like other third-party tools, Shieldmaiden is **limited to SRD content by default** due to licensing. DMs must input homebrew or non-SRD monsters themselves (which the tool makes easy, but it’s an extra step). However, many see that as a fair trade for a powerful free tool. In summary, user sentiment around Shieldmaiden is very positive – it’s viewed as a **cutting-edge solution** filling gaps left by both pen-and-paper and official tools.

### Improved Initiative (Web)

**Overview:** *Improved Initiative* is a popular free web-based combat tracker that’s been around for several years, developed by Evan Bailey and open-sourced on GitHub. It focuses on fast and adaptable encounter management, living up to its name by greatly improving on a simple initiative list. Many DMs adopted Improved Initiative (II) as a go-to tool before newer entrants appeared, and it’s often recommended alongside or in comparison to HeroMuster (a similar tracker).

**Key Features:** Improved Initiative offers both an **encounter builder** and an **initiative tracker** in one, though building encounters within it is fairly basic (text search or browse for monsters by name/category, then add to encounter). It provides a full compendium of **5e SRD monsters and stats**, and you can import custom creatures (it uses the open 5e data; anything beyond SRD must be input manually or via JSON import). For each encounter, you can save a list of player characters and monsters. When you start combat, it can **roll initiative for all creatures automatically** (with options to adjust or manually enter values as needed). The tracker interface then shows the turn order with each participant’s **HP, AC, and other stats** visible. The DM can click on a character/monster to see its stat block on the side panel and even click on its attacks or saves to roll them on the fly.

During combat, Improved Initiative lets the DM apply damage or healing to any combatant: clicking their HP opens a field to enter how much damage (or negative for healing). It includes a round counter and can enforce a **turn timer** (to prompt players to act faster). Additional features in settings include showing/hiding monster HP from players, and a combat log to record events. Notably, II introduced a **Player View** mode: you can send players a link to a read-only view of the initiative order. This shared view is great for remote games, letting players see who’s up next and the round progression (while keeping monster stats hidden, if you choose).

Improved Initiative also supports some customization: you can **tag combatants** or mark conditions (there are icons you can toggle on each combatant for things like used reaction, custom tags, or to hide a combatant from the player view). However, the tool does not deeply track conditions durations or automatically enforce anything beyond what the DM marks. It’s primarily a tracker and reference – it doesn’t auto-calc damage application or enforce resistances (the DM must manually adjust HP accordingly).

A big draw is **offline capability**: the web app caches data in the browser, so you can use Improved Initiative without internet once it’s loaded. This reliability (no server needed mid-game) has been a “game-changer” for some groups. However, a downside is that by default, your data (encounters, custom monsters) are saved locally in your browser storage. If you switch devices or clear cache, the data doesn’t carry over. To address this, the developer provided options: you can **export your data to a JSON file** and import it on another device. There’s also a Patreon subscription option that enabled cloud account sync, so supporters can have their data persist across devices without manual import.

As for the 2024 update – Improved Initiative being system-agnostic to an extent (it even supports other RPGs like Pathfinder with custom templates) – there’s no explicit mention of One D\&D changes. It’s likely the tool will continue to function for core combat since D\&D’s turn structure remains the same. It may not automatically include new monsters or rules until/unless the open-source data is updated (and proprietary 2024 content won’t be included due to licensing).

**Pricing:** **Free and open-source.** All features can be used free. The developer has a Patreon for those who want to support, which offers benefits like the aforementioned cloud save/sync and perhaps early access to new features. The cost of Patreon was around \$5/month for premium syncing. But importantly, anyone can use the core app at no cost, making it a favorite *budget-friendly* option. It’s essentially a community-driven alternative to D\&D Beyond’s tracker (the site even bills itself as “a free alternative to the D\&D Beyond Encounter Builder”).

**User Experience & Sentiment:** Improved Initiative is praised for being **feature-rich and comprehensive** – “everything you’ve ever asked for and more” in an initiative tracker, as one review put it. Users love the player-facing view, the ability to pre-plan and save encounters, and tweak monsters or spells for homebrew. It basically set a high bar that newer tools try to surpass. That said, it has some **UX drawbacks**. The interface, while functional, can feel cluttered or unintuitive in places. For example, as one detailed review noted: the round counter was hidden in a settings menu by default, key actions like the “next turn” button were tucked in collapsible menus, and applying damage via the HP field was not clearly labeled (it required typing a number, positive or negative, which wasn’t obvious without reading instructions). The same review criticized that opening the HP edit box multiple times could spawn multiple input fields overlapping, calling the tool “barebones and clumsy” in execution. Another pain point: while you can edit a creature’s max HP or AC mid-combat via a quick edit, you *cannot directly adjust their current HP* except through the damage/heal input process – so correcting a mistake requires some workarounds (there is also no ‘undo’ for accidentally advancing turn or applying damage). These UI issues led that reviewer to prefer other tools for a smoother experience.

Community sentiment on Reddit and forums remains largely positive for II’s functionality (fast, reliable, and **free**), but some do acknowledge it feels a bit dated now. DMs who value polish might migrate to Shieldmaiden or others, whereas those who want an open, offline-capable solution stick with Improved Initiative. It’s telling that Arcane Eye’s initiative tracker roundup gave Improved Initiative a perfect 10/10 for cost and high marks for features, but did note the learning curve and that it’s tied to your device unless you manage JSON files or sub to Patreon. Overall, Improved Initiative is seen as **powerful but slightly clunky**. It occupies a middle ground: far more automated than pen-and-paper or a spreadsheet, but not as slick as newer UIs.

### Hero Muster (Web)

**Overview:** *HeroMuster* is another web-based encounter and initiative tracker, notable for being **mobile-first** in design. It preceded Improved Initiative and shares some similarities. Hero Muster’s encounter builder allows adding PCs and NPCs, searching the monster database (likely SRD), and then running the encounter with a turn tracker. It’s essentially a streamlined tool that feels like a spreadsheet tailored for initiative, with extra integration.

**Key Features & Differences:** Hero Muster integrates D\&D 5e rules by automatically factoring in initiative bonuses and such. It supports other RPG systems as well (advertises multi-system support, including Shadowrun, etc.). Its interface is simplified for mobile use – for example, it might not show as many panels at once as Improved Initiative, but still gives the essentials: turn order, HP tracking, and condition notes. It reportedly can track status conditions in real-time and has system-specific rule toggles (like whether a system uses static or dynamic initiative). Essentially, Hero Muster tries to take the “best parts of spreadsheets” (easy editing, sorting) and package them in a phone-friendly web app.

**Offline/Device Tie:** A known drawback: Hero Muster saves data in your browser cache, meaning your encounter setups and inputs are tied to that device. If you switch to another computer or clear data, you won’t see your previous encounters. There is currently no cloud account login. Improved Initiative had the same limitation but later provided export options; Hero Muster similarly leaves it to the user to manually save data. This can be a pain point for DMs who prepare on one device and run games on another.

**Pricing:** Hero Muster is free to use. There may be a donation or premium version, but core features are free with no indication of a paywall for basic use.

**User Sentiment:** Hero Muster is generally liked for its **simplicity and mobile optimization**. GMs who run games from a tablet or phone appreciate that it “sidesteps \[spreadsheets’] drawbacks” like fiddly formatting, and offers an interface designed for touch. However, many users eventually transitioned to Improved Initiative, which they found more **fully featured**. In fact, one comparison noted that while Hero Muster gives you “just about everything you can ask for,” Improved Initiative gives you *even more* (particularly a better UI and more features). The lack of cross-device sync is the main complaint, as mentioned. In an Arcane Eye ranking, Hero Muster was considered a strong option but slightly edged out by Improved Initiative in terms of depth. Still, if someone’s priority is a lightweight tracker accessible on a phone without setup, Hero Muster is a viable choice.

### Other Notable Tools

* **Kobold Fight Club (Kobold Plus)** – *Encounter builder (Web).* Kobold Fight Club is a legendary web app for *building* balanced encounters. The revived “Kobold Plus” version provides extensive monster filtering (by CR, type, environment, etc.) and even random encounter generation (with presets like “boss + minions” or “horde”). You can include homebrew monsters by importing data (CSV, JSON, Google Sheets). While KFC does **not itself track combat rounds** (it has no turn tracker), it exports directly to Improved Initiative for running the battle. So many DMs use Kobold for prep and then II or others for the actual combat. It’s free and focused on the encounter setup phase. In context of our research, its key contribution is robust homebrew support and ease of finding monsters – something some integrated tools lack. For instance, D\&D Beyond’s builder is fine if you have the content, but Kobold Plus, using open data, lets you filter and generate without owning books, albeit limited to SRD + any custom imports. User sentiment on Kobold Plus is very positive as an encounter planner (fast, useful inspiration).

* **Roll20 (Virtual Tabletop – Web)** – *Roll20* is a full VTT platform, but relevant here because it includes an **initiative tracker and turn management** that many groups use by default. In Roll20, initiative is tied to tokens on a virtual map; you can have players and monsters roll initiative (with D\&D 5e sheets, it can auto-add their Dexterity mod) and then use the **Turn Tracker** panel to cycle through turns. Roll20’s combat tracker is basic: it lists the turn order and current round, and highlights whose token is active. It doesn’t inherently track actions or conditions without manual input (though you can add custom markers on tokens to denote conditions). Some one-click automations exist, like rolling initiative for all selected tokens at once. Roll20’s strength is integration: because it’s a live online tabletop, all players are already connected and can see the turn order. The GM can also use APIs (with a Pro subscription) to script more advanced combat management (for example, there are community API scripts that auto-apply damage or manage status effects). However, **limitations** include lack of a dedicated mobile app (players on phones have to use a browser, which isn’t very mobile-friendly), and without advanced scripts, condition tracking is largely manual. Large combats with many tokens/effects can also lag the system. Pricing: Roll20’s base features (including initiative tracker) are free, but things like dynamic lighting and API scripts require a Pro sub (\~\$9.99/mo or \~\$100/yr). User sentiment: People appreciate Roll20’s convenience (no extra tools if you’re already using it for maps) and official content integration (modules you buy often come with pre-filled encounters and statblocks). Yet, compared to dedicated trackers, Roll20 is **less specialized** – DMs mention it lacks features like sophisticated condition handling or action tracking unless you put in effort to customize macros. It’s essentially a *jack-of-all-trades* that can serve as a combat tracker but not with the depth of purpose-built tools.

* **Foundry VTT (Virtual Tabletop – self-hosted Web)** – *Foundry Virtual Tabletop* is another major VTT which, unlike Roll20, is a self-hosted application (the GM runs a server, players join via browser). Foundry’s built-in **combat tracker** is quite powerful: it supports things like decimal initiative (for tiebreakers or systems like lair actions at 20.1, etc.), automatically pulls in initiative bonuses from character sheets, and can account for specific rules (e.g. the Alert feat’s +5 is automatically applied). It displays the round number and has an easy next-turn button, with options to automatically begin a new round when the list cycles. Foundry also natively tracks conditions if you apply them to tokens – though how they affect gameplay depends on the game system’s rules integration (for D\&D5e, many conditions will automatically adjust rolls or movement when applied). What makes Foundry stand out is its **extensibility via modules**. The community has created modules like *Combat Carousel* (which gives a slick visual turn order display), *Combat Enhancements* (adding turn highlighting, advanced initiative options, and condition automation), and *Turn Marker* (which shows a big indicator on the map for who’s acting). These can significantly upgrade the combat experience. Essentially, a tech-savvy GM can tailor Foundry’s combat tracker to be as detailed as they want – including tracking used actions or legendary actions through custom status icons or mods. Foundry’s pros are its power and **one-time cost** (\$50 license, no subscription for core software). But cons in this context: it’s not a simple plug-and-play web app (requires setup and possibly port forwarding or a separate hosting service), and players must connect to the GM’s server. It’s also heavier, being a full VTT (including maps, tokens, etc.), so using it solely for turn tracking is overkill for some. User sentiment: Foundry is beloved by those who invest time in it –  it’s considered *state-of-the-art* for VTT and highly customizable. Yet, those looking purely for a lightweight tracker might find it too complex. Importantly, Foundry (with mods) is well-positioned to adapt to 2024 rules – the active dev community will likely update the D\&D5e system module to incorporate new rules once OGL permits, meaning it’s future-proof in that regard.

* **Owlbear Rodeo (Web)** – *Owlbear Rodeo* is a lightweight, free web VTT focused on simplicity. It recently introduced *extensions*, one of which is a basic **Initiative Tracker** plugin. Owlbear’s initiative tracker allows adding tokens to a turn list and sharing it with all players in the session (everyone sees the order). It sorts the order and highlights whose turn it is, but doesn’t do much beyond that – no HP or condition tracking by default. Some community extensions (like “Game Master’s Grimoire”) add combined HP and initiative management with simple stat blocks for D\&D5e. The philosophy of Owlbear is minimalism, so it’s great for theater-of-the-mind combat where you just need an order and maybe quick notes. Being entirely web-based with no login required for players, it’s very accessible. User sentiment: extremely positive for ease of use – many DMs say “it just works” for quick games. But for advanced tracking (actions, conditions) it relies on manual methods or extra tools, thus it’s not a comprehensive solution by itself.

* **Mobile Apps (Offline)** – A variety of mobile apps exist for combat tracking, such as **Combat Tracker 5e**, **Game Master 5th Edition** (Android/iOS), **Fight Club 5** (which is more a character manager but has encounter features), and **Encounter+** (iOS). These are outside the scope of web tools, but worth noting: they often allow tracking combat on a phone or tablet with similar features (initiative list, HP, conditions). For instance, *Game Master 5e* app offers multi-encounter management and a simple turn tracker, and *Encounter+* on iPad even includes a map and initiative manager with automation. Pricing for these ranges from free (with ads) to a few dollars one-time. The drawback is they’re not inherently synchronized across multiple players (usually one device for the DM). Some, like Encounter+, have networking to share a player view to others on Wi-Fi, but it’s not cloud-based. These apps fill the niche for offline or at-the-table use where each person might not have a laptop – however, in the era of online play and web tools, their relevance is a bit diminished except for specific use cases.

| **D\&D Beyond** (Official, Web)    | - **Initiative & round tracking**, add PCs/monsters from DDB content<br>- **Monster statblocks & dice rolling** integrated (DM can roll attacks/damage)<br>- Auto-calculates encounter difficulty (CR)<br>- *Limited DM controls:* cannot apply damage or conditions to PCs<br>- Integrating with new **Maps VTT** for 2024 rules encounters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Free basic; requires buying digital books for full monster access. *Combat tracker beta was sub-only.* **Subscription (\$3–\$6/mo)** for sharing content, etc.                                | Web browser (desktop, tablet). *No dedicated mobile app* (site is mobile-accessible). Players need DDB accounts for character integration.                                          | **Polished but incomplete.** UI is clean and easy, and integration with official content is a plus. However, widely criticized for missing core features (no player HP editing: “useless as a combat tracker”). Expensive if you’re not already invested. Transition to map-based interface for 2024 has some users frustrated (prefer classic tracker).                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Shieldmaiden** (Web app)         | - **All-in-one:** encounter builder, **initiative tracker**, and detailed combat manager<br>- **Full action management:** roll attacks/saves in-app, auto-calc hits & damage with resistances, apply conditions, track temp HP<br>- **Homebrew friendly:** create or import custom monsters, spells, items<br>- **Player view** with shareable initiative display, plus ambiance (visual effects, music) for immersion<br>- **DDB sync:** Chrome extension to import character sheets                                                                                                                                                         | Core features **free** (up to certain data limits). **Patreon subscription (\~\$5/mo)** expands limits (more combatants, unlimited saves) and adds perks (image uploads, advanced visuals).   | Web (desktop & mobile; designed to feel like an app). Players join via browser link (no login needed).                                                                              | **Highly praised – “most comprehensive” tool**. Users love its depth and flexibility; it **streamlines DM bookkeeping** so they “focus on the game”. Considered **feature-rich** (far beyond other trackers) yet with a modern, usable UI. Rapidly updated by devs. Only drawback: limited to SRD content unless custom input (no official monster compendium by default).                                                                                                                                              |
| **Improved Initiative** (Web)      | - **Initiative tracking & HP management** with auto-roll initiative option<br>- Quick stat lookups: monster and PC statblocks in sidebar<br>- **Apply damage/healing** by input (manual, not automated)<br>- Condition tagging (e.g. mark reactions used, hide/unhide combatants)<br>- **Player link** for turn order display<br>- Works offline (browser cached), JSON import/export for data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Free** and open-source. Optional Patreon (\~\$5/mo) for cloud sync and support.                                                                                                             | Web (desktop and mobile browser). Offline capable once loaded. No separate app (3rd-party wrappers exist).                                                                          | **Powerful and proven**, but UI is a bit dated. Many DMs rely on it as a free alternative to DDB. Offers “everything you’ve asked for and more” in features and is system-agnostic. Criticized for clunky interface: some controls are hidden or not intuitive (e.g. round counter buried in settings). No built-in undo, so mistakes can be hard to correct. Overall sentiment: very useful and customizable, but **lacks polish** – some prefer newer tools for better UX.                                            |
| **Roll20** (VTT, Web)              | - **Built-in turn tracker** tied to tokens on a map (auto-sorts initiative, highlights current token)<br>- Integrates with character sheets for initiative mods, etc<br>- **Macros & API:** Pro users can add scripts for auto-calculating damage, tracking conditions, etc.<br>- Official modules: if you buy an adventure, encounters come pre-configured with monsters and init tokens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Free** for core use. **Plus (\$50/yr)** or **Pro (\$100/yr)** subscriptions add features (dynamic lighting, API scripts, more storage). Marketplace for modules & content (various prices). | Web (browser). *No official mobile app* (tablet browser works; mobile is rough). Supports multi-player real-time use by design (everyone in same online game room).                 | **Ubiquitous but basic**. Strength is that many groups already use it; the tracker “works seamlessly” within the VTT. User feedback: good for an integrated solution, but **limited automation** unless you add API scripts. Some complain about performance with many combatants/effects. Lacks dedicated features for action management (no native way to track used bonus action, etc., aside from custom token markers). Great for combined map-and-tracker use; not the most **feature-rich** purely as a tracker. |
| **Foundry VTT** (VTT, self-hosted) | - **Robust combat tracker:** supports complex init (decimal tiebreakers, special turn orders); shows round, turn, and can automate end-of-round effects with modules<br>- **Condition & status tracking:** tokens have condition flags that can auto-apply effects (5e system) – e.g. *Stunned* can impose advantage on attacks, etc.<br>- **Community modules:** e.g. Combat Carousel (visual timeline), Combat Enhancements (turn alerts, auto-conditions), and more for custom needs. Highly configurable via API.                                                                                                                         | **\$50 one-time** for a Foundry license (GM only). No recurring fees for core software. (*Players join free.*) Premium D\&D content can be purchased or imported via third-party tools.       | Desktop app for GM (Windows/Mac/Linux). Players connect via Web browser. (Can self-host or pay for a hosting service.) Limited mobile support (UI not optimized for small screens). | **Powerful and extensible.** Widely praised by experienced GMs for flexibility – 68% of Foundry users add combat mods to enhance it. Considered a **premium solution** for those willing to invest time. User sentiment: excellent automation potential (some run almost fully automated combats), but **setup is non-trivial**. Not ideal if you want a quick, lightweight tracker. Also, not truly cloud-based out of the box, which limits “pick up and play” cross-platform ease.                                   |
| **Others (brief)**                 | **Hero Muster** (Web/mobile): Similar to Improved Initiative but mobile-first. Free. Lacks cloud sync (local browser only). *Sentiment:* easy on phone, but superseded by more advanced tools.<br>**Owlbear Rodeo** (Web VTT): Ultra-light tracker via extension. Free. Great for simplicity, but minimal features (no built-in conditions or automation). Loved for quick use, not depth.<br>**Mobile apps (GM5, Encounter+ etc.)**: Platform-specific, often offline. Good for single-device use; not inherently multi-user synced. *Sentiment:* handy for analog games, but most online groups prefer web solutions for real-time sharing. | Varies (mostly free or one-time cheap apps).                                                                                                                                                  | Varies (Hero Muster and Owlbear are web; others are iOS/Android apps).                                                                                                              | Many niche tools cater to specific needs (e.g. custom initiative systems, or physical card trackers for in-person play). They indicate demand for alternatives, but none have dominated the space like the above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Gaps in the Market and User Pain Points

The above analysis reveals several areas where current tools fall short, either in functionality, cost, or accessibility. Key gaps and pain points include:

* **Limited Action Economy Tracking:** Almost no mainstream tool explicitly tracks whether a character has used their **Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction** in a turn. DMs often resort to memory or pen-and-paper notes for this. For example, a player might ask “Did I use my reaction already?” – most digital trackers don’t have a built-in indicator to answer that. Improved Initiative at least lets a DM tag a combatant’s icon for “reaction used”, and one can manually use conditions (like a custom “BA used” status) in tools like Shieldmaiden or Foundry. But there’s a gap for a system that elegantly tracks *per-turn action usage* and resets it each round. A dedicated UI for ticking off a monster’s legendary actions, lair actions, or a PC’s action types could be a welcome innovation.

* **Incomplete Feature Integration in Official Solutions:** D\&D Beyond, despite its official data and polish, lacks key combat management features (applying damage to PCs, conditions, mid-combat adjustments). The community has noticed that hobbyist or third-party tools (some free) outshine the official one in functionality. Moreover, DDB’s pivot to a map-based encounter system for 2024 content has alienated some users who just want a simple tracker. This opens an opportunity: a web tool that can incorporate the *updated 2024 rules (e.g. new monster math or encounter balancing)* without forcing a VTT interface. Users on D\&D Beyond’s forums expressed desire for the old encounter builder/tracker workflow with the new rules, implying a gap that a third-party could fill if it uses the upcoming revised SRD.

* **Cost Barriers and Ecosystem Lock-In:** Many advanced tools require significant payment or content purchase:

  * D\&D Beyond: full utility requires buying books (often noted as paying twice if you own physical) and possibly a subscription.
  * Fantasy Grounds: high upfront license cost (and players might need paid copies unless the DM has an Ultimate license) – not to mention paid modules for content.
  * Roll20: free core, but some automation needs subscription, and official bestiary access comes from buying modules.
  * Foundry: \$50 is reasonable one-time, but adding convenience (like a reliable hosting server or premade content) can incur extra costs.

  Users on a budget or who aren’t invested in one ecosystem feel left out by these. This is evidenced by the popularity of free tools like Improved Initiative and Shieldmaiden. However, free tools often lack official data (due to legal reasons) – the gap here is a unified platform that **keeps cost low** while making it easy for users to bring in the content they need (perhaps via user sharing or community-created data that doesn’t violate IP). The success of Shieldmaiden’s freemium model shows many DMs are willing to support a good tool, but making it *usable* without upfront cost is key to adoption.

* **Fragmentation and Lack of Integration:** Many groups end up using multiple tools: e.g. Kobold Fight Club to build encounters, then a tracker like Improved Initiative to run combat, plus maybe a separate thing for music or maps. Juggling multiple apps/sites can be cumbersome. Shieldmaiden’s all-in-one approach directly addresses this gap, but not everyone knows about it yet. There’s still room to integrate even further – for example, integrating a combat tracker with popular VTTs or communication platforms (a bot for Discord that syncs with a web tracker, etc.). Foundry and Roll20 do a lot but are heavier solutions. A lightweight tracker that can *optionally* sync with, say, a VTT or D\&D Beyond’s character stats via API could attract users who currently alt-tab between tools.

* **Web-Based & Cross-Platform Demand:** Some older solutions (like **Fantasy Grounds**, or even some mobile apps) are not truly cross-platform web tools. Fantasy Grounds is a powerful combat tracker/VTT with effects automation and such, but it requires a standalone application (Windows/Mac) – no web browser play. That makes it less accessible, especially on mobile or for players who can’t install software. The trend in recent years clearly favors web-based, no-install tools (even Foundry essentially runs in a browser for players). The gap is essentially closed by offerings like Roll20, Foundry (players side), and pure web apps, but any tool not on the web is at a disadvantage now. Users explicitly ask for cross-device support – e.g., Hero Muster and Improved Initiative received criticism for not syncing between PC and phone by default. The expectation is that you can log in from anywhere or share a link and continue seamlessly. Tools that don’t address this feel outdated. Thus, there’s an opportunity for newcomers to ensure **cloud synchronization and device-agnostic design** from the start.

* **User Experience Pain Points:** Beyond missing features, **usability** can be a deciding factor. Several pain points emerge:

  * **Clunky UI / Steep Learning Curve:** Improved Initiative’s interface, as noted, confuses some with hidden options. Foundry, while powerful, can overwhelm new users with complexity and configuration. Even D\&D Beyond’s interface had some awkward navigation (e.g. starting a new encounter instead of showing list of saved ones). There’s room for a tool with an intuitive UI that requires minimal training – something as straightforward as pen-and-paper, but digital. The Arcane Eye review scoring ease-of-use shows variation: DDB got 9/10 for ease while a more powerful tool might score lower. The ideal gap-filler is **both** powerful *and* easy to use.
  * **Lack of customization in UI:** Some DMs have unique preferences (e.g. large text for projector display, color themes to match their stream overlay, etc.). Outside of Foundry (which you can theme via modules) and maybe Shieldmaiden’s light/dark mode, others don’t offer much personalization. Given diverse use cases (in-person games with a shared screen vs remote play vs streaming online games), adaptability is a plus.
  * **Players’ involvement:** Most tools are DM-centric – players are passive viewers of the turn order. A few exceptions (e.g. Foundry, where players control their token stats, or if using D\&D Beyond’s character HP sync). Some groups might want players to mark their own conditions or clicks “Done” on their turn to inform the tracker. There’s an opportunity for a tracker that gives **players limited interactive control**: for example, a player could press a button to indicate their turn is complete, or spend their reaction which then flags them until next round. This kind of interaction is rare currently (it would require either accounts for players or a shared interface with permissions). Providing it would set a tool apart, especially for remote play to keep players engaged.

* **Staying Updated with Rules Changes:** With the 2024 D\&D revision, tools will need to update things like condition lists (the new Exhaustion rules, renamed “Slow” condition, etc.), new monsters and statblocks (e.g. monsters have standardized templates in 2024), and encounter balancing formulas. Users on D\&D Beyond already noticed the Encounter Builder not supporting the new *Dungeon Master’s Guide 2024* guidelines outside the Maps tool. Third-party tools will rely on the updated SRD; once that’s out, there’s a chance to quickly implement those changes and **be first to offer full 2024 compatibility**. A gap exists in the interim where official tools might lag or gate content, and community tools can step in with stop-gap solutions (for example, a custom calculator for 2024 encounter difficulty, or a toggle for old vs new rules).

In summary, while there are many options, **no single tool currently checks all the boxes** of being affordable (or free), feature-complete (covering initiative, action tracking, conditions, etc.), *and* truly easy to use across all devices. D\&D Beyond has ease and official data but lacks features; community tools have features but until recently lacked an all-in-one polished package. Shieldmaiden comes closest to filling many gaps, but as a newer entrant it hasn’t yet reached everyone and still must tread carefully around official content. This leaves niches to exploit:

* A fully **cross-platform web app** with a slick UI that explicitly tracks the action economy and conditions would address a common DM headache.
* A tool that **bridges VTT and non-VTT play**, allowing use with maps or theater of the mind equally, could attract those frustrated with being forced into one mode (exactly the issue some have with DDB’s Maps requirement).
* **Competitive pricing** (freemium or low-cost) can undercut the major commercial platforms, as long as it can sustain development perhaps via a Patreon or optional premium features (users seem willing to pay for extras that don’t gate essential functionality).

## Opportunities for Innovation

Given the gaps identified, here are clear opportunities for a new or improved product in this space:

* **Comprehensive Action Management:** Develop a combat tracker that not only tracks turn order but has dedicated mechanics for the **action economy**. For example, each combatant’s panel could have checkboxes or icons for Action, Bonus Action, Reaction, Movement, Legendary Actions, etc., which reset each round. This would be hugely helpful for both DMs and players to ensure nothing is forgotten or double-used. No popular tool currently visualizes this in a user-friendly way – implementing it would fill a known void (users have asked for such trackers on forums).

* **Real Multi-User Interaction:** Move beyond “player view only” to **player-participatory** tracking. A web tool where players can log in (or use a PIN for the session) and update limited information (like their current HP, or mark a condition on themselves, or click “turn done”) would distribute the workload and engage the whole group. This could be optional, with the DM retaining override control. Particularly for remote games, this creates a shared interactive experience and lessens DM micromanagement. Current solutions either give full control to the DM or require a full VTT; a middle-ground tool with role-based permissions would stand out.

* **Unified Ecosystem (All-in-One):** Continue the trend of consolidation (like Shieldmaiden’s approach) – a single app for encounter building, tracking, loot distribution, and even narrative aids (notes, XP, etc.). There is still space to integrate **more**: for instance, a combat tracker could integrate a dice roller for any roll, a simple map sketch or positioning helper for those who want minimal visuals, or even an initiative tracker that ties into narrative pacing (like reminding the DM of lair actions or environmental events on certain rounds). Being a one-stop-shop is convenient, and if done with a modular UI (so it doesn’t overwhelm users who only need some parts), it could attract DMs tired of juggling multiple tools.

* **Focus on Web & Mobile UX:** Build from the ground up with responsiveness in mind – ensure the interface works as smoothly on a phone as on a PC, and that it loads quickly via web. Many existing tools either prioritize desktop (Foundry, Improved Initiative’s layout) or mobile (Hero Muster) at the expense of the other. A new tool can use modern web design to adapt to both. Also, ensuring **accessibility** (screen reader compatibility, color-blind friendly design, etc.) can capture users who are often overlooked – interestingly, Shieldmaiden (HarmlessKey) highlights having screen reader support for inclusive gaming, which is unique. Expanding on that would be socially beneficial and differentiate the product.

* **Freemium but Generous Model:** The market has shown freemium can work – DMs are more likely to adopt a tool if the free tier is useful for complete sessions (and then some will upgrade out of appreciation or need for more storage). Designing a sustainable model (perhaps premium features like custom theming, large scale battles support, integration with external APIs, etc., while keeping core combat tracking free) can undercut players like D\&D Beyond who charge for fundamentals. Being **perceived as community-friendly and not paywalled** is important in the TTRPG space, which has a strong open-source and DIY ethic.

* **2024 Rules Adaptation:** There is an immediate opportunity to be **first-to-market** with full support for the 2024 D\&D rules. For example, implementing the new encounter difficulty calculations and monster statblock format as soon as the info is available (and permitted) could draw users frustrated with D\&D Beyond’s changes. Also, new rules like the revised Exhaustion (which is a tiered -1 penalty) could be tracked with a dedicated mechanic in the tool (something even DDB might not do elegantly initially). Marketing the tool as “Updated for One D\&D” or similar when the time comes would catch those actively seeking alternatives.

* **Community and Extensibility:** Encouraging a plugin or extension framework (like Foundry’s module system, but perhaps simpler) could invite community contributions. For instance, allow custom scripts or add-ons to handle niche systems or special house rules. If a new tool can balance a stable core with optional add-ons, it could appeal to both casual DMs and tinkerers. Given that Foundry requires significant setup and coding knowledge to extend, a more user-friendly customization (maybe a library of user-made condition sets, or rule toggles like “enable Grim Hollow rules”) could fill a gap.

* **Competitive positioning against VTTs:** Emphasize being **lightweight and system-neutral** for those who don’t want a full virtual tabletop. Many groups still play via voice/video with “theater of the mind” or simple maps, and they might find full VTTs overkill. A tool focused on combat tracking could market itself as the perfect companion to any play style – use it alongside physical dice and minis, or with another VTT that lacks a good tracker (e.g. someone could use it in tandem with Owlbear Rodeo which has minimal tracking). By staying narrowly focused on *combat management* (and doing it extremely well), a product can avoid competing head-to-head with giants like Roll20 and instead complement them.

In conclusion, there is a strong market opportunity for an **advanced web-based combat tracker** for D\&D 5e (and the 2024 update) that combines the **best aspects** of existing tools – the data integration of D\&D Beyond, the automation of Shieldmaiden, the ease-of-use of simpler trackers, and the cross-platform convenience of web apps – while addressing the pain points users have raised. Such a tool, especially if it keeps costs reasonable, could rapidly gain adoption by filling the voids left by current offerings. With DMs and players increasingly playing online or with digital aids, the demand for an efficient, synchronized, and comprehensive combat management system is higher than ever. The first product to truly meet that demand will likely become the new go-to solution at many gaming tables.

Me: Great work. I am going to be building a Next.js application that accomplishes this and hits the market gap with a comprehensive action economy tracker, initiative order tracker, with a particular emphasis on not needing to use the tool - users should be encouraged to make physical dice rolls. Can you give me a rough project structure I can follow along with / a to-do list for features? What features online have users requested that haven't been met? What are some pain points? Give me a high-level overview of the features this app will accomplish, while being conscious of scope creep.

ChatGPT: Thanks! To tailor a precise project structure and feature set, could you clarify a few things:

1. Will this be DM-only, or will players have their own logins and views (e.g., to check initiative order, mark actions used)?
2. Are you planning to support real-time multiplayer sync (e.g., using websockets)? Or will this be more of a solo DM assistant?
3. Do you want character/monster data persistence (e.g., saved NPCs, reusable player profiles), or are you aiming for quick ephemeral setup?

These details will help balance the high-level scope while minimizing creep.

Me: Players will ahve their own logins / views BUT we want to make sure users DO NOT NEED to log in for this first draft. The DM will create a "session" that other players can tap into as players.
2. Real-time multiplayer sync. Users will take their turns and mark their action / bonus action on their turn.
3. More on the quick ephemeral side. as a DM i don't need to see the details of players or monsters. I just need to be able to create monsters with potentially additional actions / bonus actions on a case-by-case basis. I should also be able to give other players more actions / bonus actions.

ChatGPT: Thanks! I’ll now map out a high-level project structure and feature checklist for your Next.js app based on your vision: a lightweight, web-based D&D combat tracker with real-time sync, ephemeral sessions, and comprehensive action economy tracking. I’ll also include a prioritized feature roadmap, pain points from other tools that you can solve, and specific user-requested features that remain unmet.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a structured overview and clear next steps.

# Web-Based D\&D 5e Combat Tracker – Structure & Roadmap

## 1. High-Level Next.js App Structure

* **Next.js Pages & Components:** Organize the app into a few core pages:

  * **Session Creation Page:** A simple home or `/create` page where the DM can create a new session and get a unique code/link (e.g. a 6-character session ID). This triggers creation of a session record (via an API route or direct DB call).
  * **Join Session Page:** A `/join` page (or modal) where players enter the session code (or use a direct link) to connect to the session. No account or login is required – joining is frictionless.
  * **Combat Tracker Page:** The main session interface (`/session/[code]`) that shows the initiative order and action tracker. This page is used by both DMs and players – it will render appropriate controls based on role (DM vs player). Key components here include an **Initiative List** (ordered list of combatants with their stats/action status), a **Current Turn Highlight**, and controls for **Next Turn** and **Round Counter**.

* **Real-Time Sync:** Use a real-time communication library to keep all clients in sync:

  * Leverage **WebSockets** (e.g. **Socket.IO**) or a real-time backend service (**Supabase Realtime** or **Firebase**). For example, Socket.IO can run on a Next.js custom server or a serverless function to broadcast state updates, while Supabase can sync clients via database changes.
  * The DM’s client acts as the primary controller for turn order (e.g. when the DM clicks "Next Turn", all clients update). Players’ clients send events when they use or reset an action, updating their own character’s state.
  * Each session forms a channel/room identified by the session code. All participants in that room receive updates to the initiative list and action usage in **real time**, ensuring everyone sees the current turn and statuses simultaneously.

* **State Management:** Maintain the combat state (list of combatants, turn index, round number, action usage flags, etc.) in a central store:

  * On the **frontend**, use React state or context to manage current session data, subscribing to real-time updates. Libraries like **Redux Toolkit** or Zustand could help but might be overkill for MVP; the real-time service’s callbacks can directly update local state.
  * On the **backend**, store minimal session data. For instance, using **Supabase**, have a `Sessions` table and a `Combatants` table (with fields like name, initiative, HP, and boolean flags for Action/Bonus/Reaction/Movement available). Enable Supabase’s real-time listening on these tables so clients get updates whenever a combatant’s status changes. If using Socket.IO, keep an in-memory record of the session’s state on the server (or in a lightweight store like Redis for persistence) and broadcast changes.

* **Auth and Session Management:** Keep it simple in MVP:

  * **No user login required** – treat everyone as a guest identified by the session code. The DM could receive a secret token or use a special URL to get DM privileges. For example, upon session creation, generate a **DM access token** (UUID) that the DM’s client stores (e.g. in localStorage) – this token can be passed with updates to authorize DM-only actions (like adding/removing combatants or advancing turns).
  * Use **role flags** in the session state to distinguish DM vs player. The session creation flow can mark the creating client as `role: DM`, and all joiners as `role: player` by default. Role could also be determined by whether the client presents the DM token.
  * **Session Lifetime:** Sessions are temporary/ephemeral. Data can be stored in-memory or in a volatile table. Implement a cleanup (e.g. if using a DB, set an expiration timestamp for each session or provide a way for DMs to end a session, removing it from storage).

* **Suggested Libraries/Stack:** Next.js (React) for the frontend UI and pages, and one of:

  * **Supabase** (for an all-in-one solution: Postgres database + real-time channels + optional auth). Supabase’s JS SDK can handle session creation (inserting a row) and subscribing to changes on that session’s data. This avoids setting up a custom WebSocket server and leverages row-level security for basic per-session data isolation.
  * **Socket.IO** (if a custom backend is preferred): A small Node.js server (could be integrated with Next.js using a custom server or a separate deploy) to handle real-time events. This would maintain session state in memory and use events like `joinSession`, `updateAction`, `nextTurn` to sync everyone. Socket.IO can run on the same host as Next.js via an API route (with some configuration) or on a serverless platform that supports persistent WebSocket connections.
  * **Others:** In addition or alternative, consider **NextAuth** in later versions if you introduce user accounts (not needed for MVP). For now, Next.js’ built-in API routes or server actions can handle creating/joining sessions without full auth. Also, use a UI library or components for responsiveness (ensure it’s mobile-friendly for cross-platform use).

* **Key Components:** Structure the UI into reusable components for clarity:

  * `CombatantCard` – displays a character/monster name, HP (if tracked), and action economy buttons (Action, Bonus, Reaction, Movement) that the player can toggle used/unused. The DM’s view of a CombatantCard might also include a quick “edit” option (to adjust name, HP, or remove the combatant).
  * `InitiativeTracker` – lists all CombatantCards in the current initiative order, highlights the current turn, and maybe shows round number at top.
  * `ControlsBar` – shows turn control buttons for the DM (e.g. Next Turn, Prev Turn, End Combat) and maybe a round counter. Players might not see these, or see a limited view (like a “Ready” button if needed).
  * `AddCombatantForm` – allows the DM to rapidly add a new combatant (enter name, select type PC/NPC, and optionally initiative or other stats). This could appear as a modal or sidebar on the session page for the DM.
  * **Styling/UX:** Keep design clean and minimal. A responsive layout (using CSS flex/grid or a component framework like **Chakra UI** or **Mantine**) will ensure it works on desktop, tablet, or phone. Prioritize readability: e.g. large text for names, clear icons or color indicators for action status (for instance, grey-out an icon when that action is used).

## 2. MVP Feature To-Do List (v1.0)

**Core MVP Features (Priority):**

1. **Session Creation & Join (No Login):** Implement the ability for a DM to create a temporary session that generates a shareable code or link. Players can join the session by entering the code or clicking the link, with no account required. This is top priority to reduce friction in getting started.

2. **Real-Time Initiative Tracker:** Develop the real-time syncing of initiative order and turn indicator. When the DM starts combat:

   * The DM can input or roll initiative for each combatant (or simply enter an ordered list). Sorting by initiative and a visual **current turn marker** should happen automatically.
   * All participants’ screens update simultaneously to show the correct order. The current active combatant is highlighted clearly.

3. **Turn Management Controls:** Provide controls to advance the turn and track rounds:

   * A **“Next Turn”** button for the DM that moves to the next entity in initiative. When the end of the list is reached, increment the **round counter** and loop back. (Also include a “Previous” or the ability to adjust in case of mistakes.)
   * Display the **Round number** prominently. This was a pain point in some trackers where round count was hidden in menus – our tool will show it clearly in the UI at all times.

4. **Combatant Management (Ephemeral Entries):** Allow the DM to quickly add and remove combatants on the fly:

   * Adding a combatant should be as simple as typing a name (and optionally HP or notes). If it’s a monster/NPC, the DM can specify any extra attributes (e.g. “Goblin, HP 7, 1 Action, 1 Bonus, 1 Reaction”). Defaults for action economy can be one Action, one Reaction, etc., with the ability to modify (see next point).
   * No extensive monster database integration in MVP – instead, a DM can add a monster manually in seconds. This ephemerality avoids lengthy prep and **bypasses the need for pre-loaded stats** (a common hurdle in other tools when they don’t include certain monsters by default).

5. **Action Economy Tracking:** Implement per-combatant action usage indicators:

   * For each combatant, display icons or toggles for **Action**, **Bonus Action**, **Reaction**, and **Movement**. By default at the start of their turn, all are in “available” state. As the player uses their Action or other resources, they (or the DM) can tap the icon to mark it as used (e.g. icon changes color or gets a strikethrough).
   * Reactions might be usable outside one’s turn, so the UI should allow marking a reaction as spent at any time (and it should persist until the start of that combatant’s next turn). For simplicity, when the turn advances, automatically **reset** the Action, Bonus, and Movement to available for the new active combatant, and at the end of the round, reset everyone’s Reaction availability.
   * This addresses a major gap in current trackers – most do not explicitly track whether a player or NPC has used their action or bonus action in a turn. By providing this, the tool helps **organize the action economy** so DMs and players can see at a glance who has actions left.

6. **Player Self-Service Updates:** Let players update their own status in the tracker:

   * Each player (when joining the session) can be assigned control of their character entry. They should be able to mark off their Action/Bonus/Reaction themselves on their device as they take actions. This reduces the DM’s bookkeeping workload and engages players.
   * Changes a player makes (e.g. marking their action as used) should instantly reflect on the DM’s view and others’ views. Real-time collaboration ensures the DM is always aware of each character’s state without needing to ask, fulfilling the cross-platform sync goal.

7. **Basic Turn/Status Display for All:** All participants’ views show essential info:

   * Clearly highlight whose turn it is **right now** (e.g. a colored outline or an indicator at top). Possibly show a countdown or highlight if the DM wants a soft time limit (stretch feature).
   * Show which combatants are **ready/active** and which are **done** for the round (based on their action toggles). For example, once a player marks their Action and Bonus as used, the DM can see that this character likely has nothing major left except movement or reaction.
   * Ensure the interface updates live so even a player not paying attention will notice when their turn comes up or a new round starts (e.g. an optional sound or just a visual flash, as a polish item).

8. **Minimal Stat Tracking (optional in MVP):** Since the focus is not a full rules engine, keep stat tracking to a minimum:

   * Offer an **HP field** for each combatant (so DMs or players can note current HP if they want, purely as reference). This could be manual entry or plus/minus adjustments, but **do not automate damage rolls or enforce HP calculations** in MVP. The DM can simply edit the number when needed. (This is a lesson from other trackers – overly automating can complicate things, and some, like D\&D Beyond’s, went too far the other way and allowed no player HP tracking, which users found limiting.)
   * Conditions or status effects can be left out of MVP or just provided as a **“Notes/Tags” field** on a combatant (for example, a text field or a set of simple icons like a dot or flag that the DM can label “stunned” or “blessed”). Detailed condition tracking is a stretch goal to avoid cluttering the initial UI.

9. **Responsive UI & Cross-Platform Access:** Ensure the app is usable on various devices:

   * Test the interface on desktop, tablet, and phone sizes. Many DMs use a laptop while players might join on phones, so buttons and text should be sized appropriately and the layout should adapt (e.g. the initiative list might scroll or collapse some info on small screens).
   * No native app is required – a mobile-friendly web app (possibly a **PWA** for offline caching) is sufficient in MVP. Prioritize fast loading and low latency updates for a smooth experience.

**Stretch Goals (Post-MVP, v1.1+):**

* **User Accounts & Persistence:** Introduce optional accounts so DMs can save reusable data:

  * Allow DMs to log in (with Google or email) to save frequently used **characters/monsters** or **encounters**. This would help when running multiple sessions or a long campaign, but it’s a post-MVP convenience. (The MVP’s ephemeral design meets the immediate need of quick one-shot combats without overhead.)
  * With accounts, enable features like saving a session preset, or importing player characters (possibly via an API from D\&D Beyond or other sources if the user has rights).

* **Expanded Combatant Data:** After MVP, consider adding more D\&D-specific data tracking in a lightweight way:

  * **Conditions and Effects:** a system to tag combatants with conditions (e.g. stunned, concentrating, etc.) with icons. This was something notably missing in D\&D Beyond’s tracker and could add value if done without bogging down the UI.
  * **Multiple Attacks or Legendary Actions:** Let the DM create custom action counters (e.g. “Legendary Action – 3 uses per round” or a monster with multiattack could have a simple counter for number of attacks left). In MVP, a DM can improvise this with notes, but a future feature could formalize it for ease of use.
  * **HP Automation (Opt-in):** If there’s demand, add optional tools like a simple HP calculator (where a DM can click “-5” to subtract damage). Any automation should remain optional to keep the core usage fast and manual-friendly.

* **Dice Roll Integration (Optional):** *If* users request it, integrate a basic dice roller for initiative or damage rolls, but **keep it minimal**. For example, a “Roll all initiatives” button for the DM could roll for NPCs and sort them – but players can still input their own if they rolled physical dice. This avoids turning the app into a full rules engine while offering convenience for those who want it.

* **Improved Real-Time Features:**

  * Use presence indicators (if using Supabase or similar) to show who is currently connected to the session and possibly who is typing/updating. This helps the DM know all players have joined and are ready.
  * Possibly implement a chat or log for combat events (players/DM can post a quick note like “orc used fireball – 8 damage” just for record). However, a full chat is lower priority, as it can distract; many groups will still communicate via voice or their VTT, so this would be a bonus feature.

* **Integrations and Imports:**

  * **D\&D Beyond integration:** For groups that do use D\&D Beyond, allow the DM to import player characters’ names and maybe max HP into the tracker via the D\&D Beyond campaign API. Also, if API allows, import monster stats from the user’s purchased content for quicker addition. (This addresses the content issue without providing data the user hasn’t paid for.)
  * **Compendium/SRD integration:** Connect to an open 5e SRD API to let the DM search and pull basic stat info for monsters or spells on the fly. This would save time adding common creatures, but it must be limited to SRD content to remain legal (no locked content).

* **Enhanced UI/UX:** Quality-of-life improvements once the core is solid:

  * Draggable reordering of combatants (in case someone delays or readjust initiative).
  * Undo/confirm actions – e.g. if DM hits “Next Turn” by accident, allow a quick undo to go back, to address the no-undo frustration from other tools.
  * Customizable turn order display (maybe the DM can toggle whether to show players certain info like monster HP or not, to allow fog-of-war on HP – a feature some advanced trackers have).
  * The ability to “pause” the combat or temporarily mark a break (if needed for long sessions).

## 3. Competing Tools – User Requests & Unmet Needs

To ensure our tool fills market gaps, we looked at common pain points and feature requests from popular D\&D combat trackers:

* **D\&D Beyond’s Combat Tracker (Official):** Users appreciate its integration with characters and monster data if they own the digital books, but it has major shortcomings:

  * *Minimal functionality:* The official tracker basically only sorts initiative and lets the DM tick down monster HP; it **cannot track player HP or conditions**, and players have no interactive role in it. DMs have complained that it’s “utterly useless as a combat tracker” beyond seeing turn order. Our tool addresses this by tracking the full action economy and allowing status tracking, which D\&D Beyond ignored.
  * *Login and purchase friction:* D\&D Beyond requires every user to have an account and the DM (or someone in the campaign) to have bought the content for any non-SRD monsters. Many DMs refuse to rebuy content they own physically, so they either don’t use Beyond or limit encounters to SRD monsters. Our tracker will be completely free and system-agnostic – since we don’t provide proprietary monster stats, DMs can input any creature name without legal issues or additional purchases. No login is needed for the MVP, removing the **walled garden** barrier (which even reviewers noted as a downside of Beyond despite its convenience).

* **Improved Initiative (improvedinitiative.app):** This fan-made web app is more feature-rich than D\&D Beyond’s, but users and reviewers have highlighted several issues:

  * *Cluttered UI and Hidden Info:* Improved Initiative’s interface has been called *“a mess”* and not user-friendly. Basic info like the round counter was hidden in settings and not visible by default, and key controls like advancing turn were tucked away in collapsible menus. This made it easy to miss important status info during play. Our tool is designed to surface the crucial information (current turn, round, who has acted) prominently without extra clicks.
  * *Lack of Player Interaction:* While Improved Initiative does allow a **player view** (players can join an encounter to see the tracker), it’s not clear if players can input their own updates. Typically the DM still drives most changes. In our tool, we empower players to mark their own actions used, which was a commonly desired feature for reducing DM workload.
  * *Cross-Device Sync and Persistence:* One Reddit user noted that Improved Initiative was *“not easy to use or swap between devices/computers”*, and data didn’t seamlessly sync. This suggests it may rely on local storage or require manual exports/imports for continuity. We aim to solve that by true cloud-based sessions – a player can join from a phone or laptop via the code and always get the live data. No need to export encounters or use the same device.
  * *Editing and Flexibility:* DMs found that making mid-combat adjustments in Improved Initiative was awkward. For example, correcting a mistake in HP required jumping through hoops since the quick edit wouldn’t let you directly adjust current HP, and there was **no undo** for accidental changes. Users have clearly requested easier manual overrides. Our design includes simple, direct editing (just click the HP value to change it) and plans for an undo/confirm step on critical actions to avoid irreversible mistakes.
  * *Action Tracking:* Improved Initiative does have a way to mark if a creature has used its reaction (via a small icon), but it doesn’t comprehensively track action/bonus/movement for each turn. Users who want a clearer picture of the action economy have had to resort to homemade solutions. Our tool’s core focus is exactly this gap – giving a visual tracker for all action types per turn, which is seldom addressed in existing apps.

* **Shieldmaiden (shieldmaiden.app):** Shieldmaiden is an all-in-one encounter manager and tracker that many consider feature-complete. However, it targets a different segment and leaves some needs unmet for others:

  * *Heavyweight & Complexity:* Shieldmaiden is powerful – it stores a trove of data (NPCs, items, spells) and even has audiovisual ambiance features. The downside is that it can be overkill for DMs who just want a quick tracker. Some DMs on forums expressed hesitation to use it due to its size/complexity or the need to learn a new comprehensive tool. Our tracker will appeal to those who want a **lightweight, plug-and-play solution** for combat only. No lengthy setup or data entry is required to start a fight – fulfilling the need for speed in one-shots or impromptu battles.
  * *Account Requirement:* Shieldmaiden offers a free tier, but as the developers note, storing content long-term requires an account and eventually paid tiers for more storage. In contrast, our MVP demands no account at all to get the basic functionality. This meets the requests of users who want **zero sign-up hurdles**. If a DM only needs a temporary tracker for a session, they shouldn’t have to create yet another account.
  * *Real-Time Player Updates:* It’s unclear if Shieldmaiden allows players to input their own actions or if it’s mostly DM-driven with a player view screen. Many existing tools assume the DM is sole operator and players are passive viewers. The unmet need here is giving players agency in the tracker – which our tool provides by design (each player can actively check off their actions).
  * *Customization on the Fly:* Shieldmaiden has robust monster editing and even homebrew import capabilities, but during combat it may be cumbersome to, say, give a monster a temporary extra action or trait. Our tool’s philosophy is to allow **ad-hoc adjustments** easily (for example, a DM can just add a note “+1 Legendary Action this round” or add a new temporary combatant for a summoned creature). This flexibility caters to user requests for handling unexpected combat events without fuss – something rigid trackers struggle with.

* **Other Tools (Minor mentions):** Community discussions mention things like **Kobold Fight Club/HeroMuster** (encounter builders) and older apps like **Fight Club 5e / Game Master 5** (mobile apps). Common issues raised include:

  * Data often tied to one device (no cloud sync) – our web-based approach fixes this.
  * Steep learning curve or clunky UI (Hero Muster was noted to be powerful but not user-friendly). We prioritize an intuitive UI even at the cost of fewer features.
  * Not tracking “everything we want” – for example, condition tracking or splitting monster groups for initiative. Users often have wishlists for each tool. By focusing on **the niche of initiative and action tracking**, we can excel at those user-desired features without the bloat. For instance, our tool will let a DM split or group initiative entries easily (addressing the case of rolling one initiative for a group of monsters or separating them, which some trackers handle rigidly).

In summary, the gaps our combat tracker will fill are: **true real-time collaboration**, **no-fuss setup**, and **explicit action economy tracking**, all while avoiding the downsides (clunky interface, required logins, paywalls, or distracting features) that users complain about in competing products. We focus on what DMs and players **actually need during a fight** and strip away the rest.

&#x20;*Example of a complex combat tracker UI (Improved Initiative). Many users find such interfaces unintuitive, with important info hidden in menus. Our tool will prioritize a cleaner design with all key turn info visible at a glance.*

## 4. UX Pain Points and Scope Traps to Avoid

Building on lessons from other tools and user feedback, we will be careful to avoid common pitfalls:

* **Avoid Requiring Accounts (Friction):** A huge UX pain point is forcing users to sign up or log in, especially for players who might only use the tracker for one session. The MVP will not require any logins – the **session code** join system is critical to keeping things quick and easy. (Down the road, accounts will be optional for those who want to save data, but never mandatory for players.)

* **Minimize Setup Overhead:** If a DM has to spend 15 minutes configuring an encounter or inputting data before play, the tool fails its purpose. We should allow adding combatants **in a few seconds each**. No need to fill dozens of fields or navigate complex menus. This addresses the UX pain where some trackers feel like a database form rather than a quick helper. Our design mantra: *if it’s not needed in the heat of combat, it shouldn’t be required upfront*. Defaults and template characters can help speed this up (e.g., default to one action/one bonus for a new creature, which the DM can tweak if needed).

* **Clarity over Complexity:** Combat can be chaotic; the app should bring order, not confusion. We will:

  * Use **clear visuals** (e.g. distinct icons for Action/Bonus/etc., maybe colored dots) so that at a glance everyone knows what’s used. No tiny hidden icons or ambiguous symbols.
  * Keep the layout simple – e.g., a single list for initiative (not multiple columns that split attention). In user tests and feedback from other apps, overly complex layouts slow DMs down. Improved Initiative’s three-column layout was criticized for cramming info; Shieldmaiden’s plethora of features can overwhelm. We will focus the UI on the turn order and actions, with additional info (like notes or HP) available but not dominating.
  * Ensure **responsive feedback** – when a player clicks their “Action” as used, the change should be immediately visible. Lag or uncertainty in whether an action registered can frustrate users, so real-time tech must be robust.

* **Don’t Enforce the Rules (No Over-automation):** A scope trap is trying to make the app handle all game rules (damage calculations, legal move validation, etc.). That’s out of scope – we explicitly position the tool as an **organizer, not an auto-DM**. We will not, for example, prevent a player from marking an extra action even if rules say they shouldn’t – there might be features (like Action Surge or haste) that give extra actions, and the DM can trust players to use the tool honestly. By avoiding rule enforcement logic, we keep development focused and UI uncluttered (no constant “error” popups or complex settings for rules variants).

* **Not a Full VTT or Character Sheet:** It’s tempting to keep adding features (dice rollers, maps, full character management, monster stat databases). We must resist this scope creep:

  * Integrations or nice-to-haves should not detract from the core functionality. For instance, while a dice roller or chat could be added later, they should not complicate the UI for tracking turns. Many existing solutions started simple but became bloated with non-core features, hurting usability.
  * Our niche is *complementing* in-person or VTT play, not replacing it. We won’t add battle maps or detailed character builders – users have other tools for those. Staying narrowly focused on initiative & actions will make us excellent in that area and easier to use than multi-purpose apps.

* **Common UX Pitfalls to Avoid:**

  * **Hidden Information:** As noted, we will keep vital info like round number, turn order, and action status always visible without extra clicks. No burying essential features in submenus.
  * **Complex Navigation:** The flow should be straightforward – e.g., “Create session -> add combatants -> start combat” all in one interface. If a combat ends, the DM shouldn’t be stuck in a dead session with no obvious way out (a problem in some tools). We’ll provide clear options to reset or start a new encounter.
  * **Lack of Undo/Confirmation:** Since combat moves fast, mistaken clicks happen. We’ll implement confirmations for destructive actions (like removing a combatant mid-combat) and possibly an undo for the last turn advance, so DMs feel safe using the app. This directly addresses the “no ‘undo’ button” complaint that made some trackers feel risky to use.
  * **Performance and Cross-Browser Issues:** Ensure the app runs smoothly on typical devices. Optimize the real-time syncing to handle at least, say, 10-15 combatants without lag. Also, test on multiple browsers – nothing is more frustrating than one player unable to join because the tool only works on Chrome, for example. Accessibility is part of UX: we will use accessible fonts and high-contrast mode if possible so everyone can read the info easily even on smaller screens or if color-blind (relying on more than just color to indicate used actions).

* **User Guidance but Not Obtrusive:** Provide brief instructions or tooltips for new DMs/players (since there’s no lengthy sign-up, a first-time user might need a quick pointer like “tap the Action icon to mark it used”). However, avoid long tutorials or walls of text. The interface should be intuitive enough that after one round, everyone “gets it”. If during testing we find users confused about what a button does, we’ll refine the icon or add a one-time hint. Our goal is an app that *feels easier than pen-and-paper tracking*, not one that requires a manual.

By staying focused on the **core use-case (tracking initiative and actions in real-time)** and listening to what users of other tools have been asking for, we can deliver exceptional value without falling into the traps that have ensnared others. We’ll continuously prioritize usability and simplicity, ensuring this combat tracker remains a handy **niche tool** rather than an over-scoped project. Each added feature will be measured against “does this truly enhance a DM’s combat experience or is it just nice-to-have?” – this question will keep us on track and our users happy.
